Think about how to approach the\ncomputational needs of the project using local HTC resources or the Open Science Grid (OSG).  We are not asking you to\nimplement the system! Just imagine how you would do it.  One approach is fine, but more than one approach is fine,\ntoo.  Imagine that you will run on the resources available to you at your own institution.  If your institution does not\nhave a HTC system available, then think about what kind of resources you would want or how you could get access to\nresources via the OSG.\n\n\nYour final assignment will be a written report (see below for more detail).

Below are some suggestions \u2014 feel free to answer some (or\nall) of them, or create and answer your own interesting questions:\n\n\n\n\nWhat local resources do you have access to?\n\n\nWould you use just local resources or do you need remote resources, too?\n\n\nHow would you turn your project into actual jobs?\n\n\nWhat are the resource needs of the jobs themselves?\n\n\nWhat sort of workflow, if any, would you use? Are there manual steps in your overall workflow? Could they be automated (e.g., with DAGMan)?\n\n\nHow much data do you need to move around? Which type of data situation do you have? What is your plan for data management?\n\n\nDo you think your project is better suited for HTC or HPC? Why?\n\n\nWhat security or privacy concerns do you have with your project? Do you need to do anything special regarding security?\n\n\nHow would your science be transformed by increasing the amount of computation you can use?\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n\nYou will write a short paper.  You can think of the format as an informal whitepaper, research paper, or proposal, if\nthat helps organize your paper.  Please represent yourself and your work well! Your final assignment may be posted on\nthe School website and hence be available to the public.\n\n\n\n\nThere are no precise length requirements, but 1000\u20131500 words is a good length to aim for\n\n\nPictures, charts, and diagrams are good, if they are appropriate and clear\n\n\nThe paper does not need to be journal-ready, but should be good quality and ready for public display\n\n\n\n\nSubmit your paper in as a PDF \u2014 no Word or LaTeX documents, please!\n\n\n\n\nIf you are not sure how to make a PDF, consult your department or campus IT staff for help\n\n\nEmail the PDF to the \n list\n\n\nIf the PDF is really huge, contact us and we will find another way to transfer the file (we \nshould\n be able to manage large data, right??)\n\n\n\n\nDeadline\n\n\nThe paper is due 31 August 2017.

If you have trouble getting \nssh\n access to the submit machine, ask the instructors right away! Gaining access is critical for all remaining exercises.\n\n\nLogging In\n\n\nToday, you will use the machine named \nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n for all of your exercises.\n\n\nTo log in, use a \nSecure Shell\n (SSH) client.\n\n\n\n\nOn OS\u00a0X, run the Terminal app and use the \nssh\n command, like so:\n\n\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nssh username@learn.chtc.wisc.edu\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Windows, we recommend a free client called \nPuTTY\n, but any SSH client should be fine\n\n\nOn Linux, open a terminal window and use the \nssh\n command, as exemplified above for Mac.\n\n\n\n\nIf you need help finding or using an SSH client, ask the instructors for help right away!\n\n\nOnce you have an SSH client, use it to log in to the submit machine. Some tips:\n\n\n\n\nThe hostname of the submit machine is \nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n\n\nYour username and initial password are located on the Accounts sheet of paper that you received this morning\n\n\nWhile the \npasswd\n command, your initial password will be automatically reset for you on an hourly basis. (So you probably don't want to change your password, in the first place, and definitely want to keep your sheet of paper or memorize the password).\n\n\n\n\nRunning Commands\n\n\nIn the exercises, we will show commands that you are supposed to type or copy into the command line, like this:\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nhostname\n/strong\n\n\nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n In the first line of the example above, the \n%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT%\n part is meant to show the Linux command-line prompt. You do not type this part! Further, your actual prompt probably is a bit different, and that is expected. So in the example above, the command that you type at your own prompt is just the eight characters \nhostname\n. The second line of the example, without the prompt, shows the output of the command; you do not type this part, either.\n\n\nHere are a few other commands that you can try, to learn a little bit about this machine (the examples below do not show the output from each command):\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ndate\n/strong\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nuname -a\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA suggestion for the day: Try typing into the command line as many of the commands as you can. Copy-and-paste is fine, of course, but you WILL learn more if you take the time to type each command, yourself.\n\n\nOrganizing Your Workspace\n\n\nYou will be doing many different exercises over the next few days, many of them on this submit machine. Each exercise may use many files, once finished. To avoid confusion, it may be useful to create a separate directory for each exercise.\n\n\nFor instance, for the rest of this exercise, you may wish to create and use a directory named \nmonday-1.1-login\n, or something like that.\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nmkdir monday-1.1-login\n/strong\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncd monday-1.1-login\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShowing the Version of HTCondor\n\n\nHTCondor is installed on this machine. But what version? You can ask HTCondor itself:\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncondor_version\n/strong\n\n\n$\nCondorVersion: \n8\n.7.2 Jun \n02\n \n2017\n BuildID: \n407060\n $\n\n$\nCondorPlatform: x86_64_RedHat6 $\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see from the output, we are using HTCondor 8.7.2, which is the most recently released development version.\n\n\nBackground information about HTCondor version numbers\n\n\nHTCondor always has two types of releases at one time: stable and development. HTCondor 8.4.x and 8.6.x are considered \nstable\n releases, and you can know they are stable because the second digits (e.g., 4 or 6 in these cases) are even numbers. Within one stable series, all versions have the same features (for example 8.4.0 and 8.4.8 have the same set of features) and differ only in bug and security fixes.\n\n\nHTCondor 8.7.2 is the current \ndevelopment\n release series of HTCondor. You know that it is a development release because the second digit (i.e., 7) is an odd number. Typically, the current development series (i.e., 8.7.x) has greater version numbers than the current stable series (i.e., 8.6.x), but that is not always true. In any case, development releases add new features and are more likely to have problems. For that reason, we typically do not use development releases for the School, but in this case, 8.7.2 is considered stable enough.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nHere are a few links to reference materials that might be interesting now or later.\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor home page\n\n\nHTCondor manuals\n; it is probably best to read the manual corresponding to the version of HTCondor that you use (8.7.2 for today)\n\n\nCenter for High Throughput Computing\n, our local research computing organization",

They will be useful for monitoring your jobs and available slots throughout the day.\n\n\nThis exercise should take only a few minutes.\n\n\nViewing Slots\n\n\nAs discussed in the lecture, the \ncondor_status\n command is used to view the current state of slots in an HTCondor pool.\n\n\nAt its most basic, the command is very simple:\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncondor_status\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis command, running on our (CHTC) pool, will produce a lot of output; there is one line per slot, and we typically have over 10,000 slots. TIP: You can widen your terminal window, which may help you to see all details of the output better.\n\n\nHere is some example output (what you see will be longer):\n\n\nslot1_31@e437.chtc.wisc.edu        LINUX      X86_64 Unclaimed Idle      0.000 8053  0+01:14:34\n\n\nslot1_32@e437.chtc.wisc.edu        LINUX      X86_64 Unclaimed Idle      0.000 8053  0+03:57:00\n\n\nslot1_33@e437.chtc.wisc.edu        LINUX      X86_64 Unclaimed Idle      0.000 8053  1+00:05:17\n\n\nslot1@e438.chtc.wisc.edu           LINUX      X86_64 Owner     Idle      0.300  250  7+03:22:21\n\n\nem\nslot1_1@e438.chtc.wisc.edu         LINUX      X86_64 Claimed   Busy      0.930 1024  0+02:42:08\n/em\n\n\nslot1_2@e438.chtc.wisc.edu         LINUX      X86_64 Claimed   Busy      3.530 1024  0+02:40:24\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis output consists of 8 columns:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCol\n\n\nExample\n\n\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nslot1_1@e438.chtc.wisc.edu\n\n\nSlot name and hostname\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpSys\n\n\nLINUX\n\n\nOperating system\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArch\n\n\nX86_64\n\n\nMachine architecture (e.g., Intel 64 bit)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState\n\n\nClaimed\n\n\nState of the slot (\nUnclaimed\n is available, \nOwner\n is being used by the machine owner, \nClaimed\n is matched to a job)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity\n\n\nBusy\n\n\nIs there activity on the slot?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoadAv\n\n\n0.930\n\n\nLoad average, a measure of CPU activity on the slot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMem\n\n\n1024\n\n\nMemory available to the slot, in MB\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActvtyTime\n\n\n0+02:42:08\n\n\nAmount of time spent in current activity (days + hours:minutes:seconds)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of the slot listing, there is a summary.

The columns are the different states that a slot can be in. The final row gives a summary of slot states for the whole pool.\n\n\nQuestions:\n\n\n\n\nFor the sample above, how many 64-bit Linux slots are available?

This is a huge step in learning to use an HTC system!\n\n\nThis exercise will take longer than the first two, short ones. It is the essential part of this exercise time. If you are having any problems getting the jobs to run, please ask the instructors! It is very important that you know how to run simple jobs.\n\n\nRunning a Simple Command Using a Submit File\n\n\nNearly all of the time, when you want to run an HTCondor job, you first write an HTCondor submit file for it. In this section, you will run the same \nhostname\n command as in the last exercise, but using a submit file.\n\n\nHere is a simple submit file for the \nhostname\n command:\n\n\nuniverse = vanilla\nexecutable = /bin/hostname\n\noutput = simple.out\nerror = simple.err\nlog = simple.log\n\nrequest_cpus = 1\nrequest_memory = 1MB\nrequest_disk = 1MB\n\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite those lines of text in a file named \nsimple.sub\n.\n\n\nNote:\n There is nothing magic about the name of an HTCondor submit file. It can be any filename you want. It's a good practice to always include the \n.sub\n extension, but it is not required. Ultimately, a submit file is a text file\n\n\nThe lines of the submit file have the following meanings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuniverse\n\n\nThe type of job this is. The default \nvanilla\n universe is a normal job. Later on, we will discuss other, special universes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexecutable\n\n\nThe name of the program to run (relative to the directory from which you submit).\n\n\n\n\n\n\noutput\n\n\nThe filename where HTCondor will write the standard output from your job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nerror\n\n\nThe filename where HTCondor will write the standard error from your job. This particular job is not likely to have any, but it is best to include this line for every job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlog\n\n\nThe filename where HTCondor will write information about your job run. Technically not required, it is a \nreally\n good idea to have a log file for every job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequest_*\n\n\nTells HTCondor how many \ncpus\n and how much \nmemory\n and \ndisk\n we want, which is not much, because the 'hostname' executable is pretty simple\n\n\n\n\n\n\nqueue\n\n\nTells HTCondor to run your job with the settings above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that we are not using the \narguments\n lines or \ntransfer_input_files\n because the \nhostname\n program is all that needs to be transferred from the submit server, and we want to run it without any additional options.\n\n\nDouble-check your submit file, so that it matches the text above. Then, tell HTCondor to run your job:\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncondor_submit simple.sub\n/strong\n\n\nSubmitting job(s).\n\n\n1 job(s) submitted to cluster \nem\nNNNN\n/em\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe actual cluster number will be shown instead of \nNNNN\n.\n\n\nIf, instead of the text above, there are error messages, read them carefully and then try to correct your submit file.\n\n\nNotice that \ncondor_submit\n returns back to the shell prompt right away. It does \nnot\n wait for your job to run. Instead, as soon as it has finished submitting your job into the queue, the submit command finishes.\n\n\nNow, use \ncondor_q\n and \ncondor_q -nobatch\n to watch for your job in the queue. You probably may not even catch the job in the \nR\n running state, because the \nhostname\n command runs very quickly. When the job itself is finished, it will no longer be listed in the \ncondor_q\n output.\n\n\nThe output from your job is written to the filename given in the \noutput\n line of your submit file. Thus, after the job finishes, you should be able to see the \nhostname\n output in \nsimple.out\n, since this information is usually printed to the terminal by the \nhostname\n program, and not to a special file of it's own.\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncat simple.out\n/strong\n\n\ne171.chtc.wisc.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nsimple.err\n file should be empty, unless there were issues running the \nhostname\n executable after it was transferred to the slot. The \nsimple.log\n is more complex and will be the focus of a later exercise.\n\n\nRunning a Job With Arguments\n\n\nVery often, when you run a command on the command line, it includes arguments after the command name itself:\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncat \nem\nsimple.out\n/em\n/strong\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nsleep \nem\n60\n/em\n/strong\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ndc \nem\n-e \n6 7 * p\n/em\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an HTCondor submit file, the command (or \"program\") name itself goes in the \nexecutable\n statement and \nall remaining arguments\n go into an \narguments\n statement. For example, if the full command is:\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nsleep \nem\n60\n/em\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen in the submit file, we put:\n\n\nexecutable = /bin/sleep\narguments = \n60\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Put the entire list of arguments inside one pair of double-quotes.\n\n\nFor the command-line command:\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ndc \nem\n-e \n6 7 * p\n/em\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen in the submit file, we put:\n\n\nexecutable = /usr/bin/dc\narguments = \n-e \n6 7 * p\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s try a job submission with arguments. We will use the \nsleep\n command shown above, which simply does nothing for the specified number of seconds, then exits normally. It is convenient for simulating a job that takes a while to run.\n\n\nCreate a new submit file (you name it this time) and save the following text in it.\n\n\nuniverse = vanilla\nexecutable = \nem\n/bin/sleep\n/em\n\n\nem\narguments = \n60\n/em\n\n\noutput = sleep.out\nerror = sleep.err\nlog = sleep.log\n\nrequest_cpus = 1\nrequest_memory = 1MB\nrequest_disk = 1MB\n\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\nExcept for changing a few filenames, this submit file is nearly identical to the last one. But, see the extra \narguments\n line?\n\n\nSubmit this new job. Again, watch for it to run using \ncondor_q\n and \ncondor_q -nobatch=; check once every 15 seconds or so. Once the job starts running, it will take about 1 minute to run (because of the =sleep\n command, right?), so you should be able to see it running for a bit. When the job finishes, it will disappear from the queue, but there will be no output in the output or error files, because \nsleep\n does not produce any output.\n\n\nRunning a Script Job From the Submit Directory\n\n\nSo far, we have been running programs (executables) that come with the standard Linux system. But you are not limited to standard programs. In this example, you will write a simple shell script (command line) executable in the submit directory, then write a submit file to run it.\n\n\n\n\nPut the following contents into a file named \ntest-script.sh\n:\\ \n\n\n\n\n#/bin/sh\n\n\necho 'Date: ' `date` echo 'Host: ' `hostname` echo 'System: ' `uname -spo` echo \"Program: $0\" echo \"Args: $*\" \n\n\n\n\nMake the file itself executable:\\ \n\n\n\n\n \nchmod +x test-script.sh\n \n\n\n\n\nTest your script from the command line:\\ \n\n\n\n\n \n./test-script.sh hello 42\n Date: Mon Jul 17 10:02:20 CDT 2017 Host: learn.chtc.wisc.edu System: Linux x86_64 GNU/Linux Program: ./test-script.sh Args: hello 42 \n\\ \nThis step is \nreally\n important! If you cannot run your executable from the command-line, HTCondor probably cannot run it on another machine, either. And debugging simple problems like this one is surprisingly difficult. So, if possible, test your \nexecutable\n and \narguments\n as a command at the command-line first.\n\n\n\n\nWrite the submit file (this should be getting easier by now):\\ \n\n\n\n\nuniverse = vanilla executable = \ntest-script.sh\n arguments = \"foo bar baz\" output = script.out error = script.err log = script.log request_cpus = 1 request_memory = 1 request_disk = 1 queue \n\\ \nNote:\n As this example shows, blank lines and spaces around the = sign do not matter to HTCondor. Use whitespace to make things clear to \nyou\n. What format do you prefer to read?\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the job, wait for it to finish, check the output. (Are you surprised by the \nProgram:\n line in the output? Why is it like that? Google for it, or ask an instructor if you are curious, although the answer is not that exciting.)\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, the \nexecutable\n that was named in the submit file did \nnot\n start with a \n/\n, so the location of the file is relative to the submit directory itself. In other words, in this format the executable must be in the same directory as the submit file.\n\n\nExtra Challenge 1\n\n\nBelow is a simple Python script that does something similar to the shell script above.

When things go wrong with your job, it is usually the first place you should look for important messages. Plus, there is other useful information there.\n\n\nThis exercise is short. If you do not have time for it now, come back and visit it later.\n\n\nReading a Log File\n\n\nFor this exercise, we can reuse any previous job that you have run. The example output below is based on the \nsleep 60\n job.\n\n\nA job log file is updated throughout the life of a job, usually at key events. Each event starts with a heading that indicates what happened and when. Here are \nall\n of the event headings from the \nsleep\n job log (detailed output in between headings has been omitted here):\n\n\n000 (5739.000.000) 07/25 10:44:20 Job submitted from host: \n128.104.100.43:9618?addrs=...\n\n001 (5739.000.000) 07/25 10:45:11 Job executing on host: \n128.104.55.42:9618?addrs=...\n\n006 (5739.000.000) 07/25 10:45:20 Image size of job updated: 72\n006 (5739.000.000) 07/25 10:46:11 Image size of job updated: 4072\n005 (5739.000.000) 07/25 10:46:11 Job terminated.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a lot of extra information in those lines, but you can see:\n\n\n\n\nThe job ID: cluster 5739, process 0 (written \n000\n)\n\n\nThe date and local time of each event\n\n\nA brief description of the event: submission, execution, some information updates, and termination\n\n\n\n\nSome events provide no information in addition to the heading.

This can be helpful information, so that in future runs of the job, you can tell HTCondor how much memory you will need.

When do events appear in the log file?\n\n\nAfter the termination event appears, press Control-C to end the \ntail\n command and return to the shell prompt.\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding How HTCondor Writes Files\n\n\nWhen HTCondor writes the output, error, and log files, does it erase the previous contents of the file or does it add new lines onto the end? Let\u2019s find out!\n\n\nFor this exercise, we can use the \nhostname\n job from earlier.\n\n\n\n\nEdit the \nhostname\n submit file so that it uses new and unique filenames for output, error, and log files\\ \nAlternatively, delete any existing output, error, and log files from previous runs of the \nhostname\n job.\n\n\nSubmit the job three separate times in a row (there are better ways to do this, which we will cover in the next lecture)\n\n\nWait for all three jobs to finish\n\n\nExamine the output file: How many hostnames are there? Did HTCondor erase the previous contents for each job, or add new lines?\n\n\nExamine the log file\u2026 carefully: What happened there? Pay close attention to the times and job IDs of the events.\n\n\n\n\nIf you have questions about how HTCondor handles these files, you could try finding relevant sections of the manual (this is hard and not as useful as one would hope), discuss it with neighbors or instructors, or ask questions at the end of this session.",

However, on some HTCondor pools, if your job goes over the request values, it may be removed from the execute machine and either held (awaiting action on your part) or rerun later. So it can be a disadvantage to you if you do not declare your resource needs or if you underestimate them. If you overestimate them, your jobs will match to fewer slots (and with a longer average wait time) \nand\n you'll be hogging up resources that you don't need, but that could be used for the jobs of other users. In the long run, it works better for all users of the pool if you declare what you really need.\n\n\nBut how do you know what to request? In particular, we are concerned with memory and disk here; requesting multiple CPUs and using them is covered a bit in later school materials, but true HTC splits work up into jobs that each use as few CPU cores as possible (one CPU core is always best to have the most jobs running soonest).\n\n\nDetermining Resource Needs Before Running Any Jobs\n\n\nIt can be very difficult to determine the memory needs of your running program. Typically, the memory size of a job changes over time, making the task even trickier. If you have knowledge ahead of time about your job\u2019s maximum memory needs, use that, or a maybe a number that's just a bit higher, to be safe. If not, then it's best to run your program in a single test job, first, and let HTCondor tell you in the log file (or in the \ncondor_q -nobatch\n output, if you're able to watch it), which is covered in the next section on \"Determining Resource Needs by Running Test Jobs\".\n\n\nRunning a Job Locally On our shared submit server \nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n, you should not run computationally-intensive work because it can use resources needed by HTCondor to manage the queue for all uses. However, you may have access to other computers where you can observe the memory usage of a program. The downside is that you'll have to watch a program run for essentially the entire time, to make sure you catch the maximum memory usage.\n\n\nFor Memory: On Mac and Windows, for example, the \"Activity Monitor\" and \"Task Manager\" applications may be useful. On a Mac or Linux system, you can use the \nps\n command or the \ntop\n command in the Terminal to watch a running program and see (roughly) how much memory it is using. Full coverage of these tools is beyond the scope of this exercise, but here are two quick examples:\n\n\nUsing \nps\n:\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nps ux\n/strong\n\n\nUSER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   \nem\nRSS\n/em\n TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND\n\n\ncat      24342  0.0  0.0  90224  \nem\n1864\n/em\n ?

If your program runs long enough, you can run this command several times and note the greatest value.\n\n\nUsing \ntop\n:\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ntop -u \nem\nuserid\n/em\n/strong\n\n\ntop - 13:55:31 up 11 days, 20:59,  5 users,  load average: 0.12, 0.12, 0.09\n\n\nTasks: 198 total,   1 running, 197 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie\n\n\nCpu(s):  1.2%us,  0.1%sy,  0.0%ni, 98.5%id,  0.2%wa,  0.0%hi,  0.1%si,  0.0%st\n\n\nMem:   4001440k total,  3558028k used,   443412k free,   258568k buffers\n\n\nSwap:  4194296k total,      148k used,  4194148k free,  2960760k cached\n\n\n\n  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  \nem\nRES\n/em\n  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND\n\n\n24342 cat       15   0 90224 \nem\n1864\n/em\n 1096 S  0.0  0.0   0:00.26 sshd\n\n\n24343 cat       15   0 66096 \nem\n1580\n/em\n 1232 S  0.0  0.0   0:00.07 bash\n\n\n25927 cat       15   0 12760 \nem\n1196\n/em\n  836 R  0.0  0.0   0:00.01 top\n\n\n30052 cat       16   0 90720 \nem\n2456\n/em\n 1112 S  0.0  0.1   0:00.69 sshd\n\n\n30053 cat       18   0 66096 \nem\n1624\n/em\n 1236 S  0.0  0.0   0:00.37 bash\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \ntop\n command (shown here with an option to limit the output to a single user ID) also shows information about running processes, but updates periodically by itself. Type the letter \nq\n to quit the interactive display. Again, the highlighted \nRES\n column shows an approximation of memory usage.\n\n\nFor Disk: Determining disk needs may be a bit simpler, because you can check on the size of files that a program is using while it runs. However, it is important to count all files that HTCondor counts to get an accurate size. HTCondor counts \neverything\n in your job sandbox toward your job\u2019s disk usage:\n\n\n\n\nThe executable itself\n\n\nAll \"input\" files (anything else that gets transferred TO the job, even if you don't think of it as \"input\")\n\n\nAll files created during the job (broadly defined as \"output\"), including the captured standard output and error files that you list in the submit file.\n\n\nAll temporary files created in the sandbox, even if they get deleted by the executable before it's done.\n\n\n\n\nIf you can run your program within a single directory on a local computer (not on the submit server), you should be able to view files and their sizes with the \nls\n command.\n\n\nDetermining Resource Needs By Running Test Jobs (BEST)\n\n\nDespite the techniques mentioned above, by far the easiest approach to measuring your job\u2019s resource needs is to run one or a small number of sample jobs and have HTCondor itself tell you about the resources used during the runs.\n\n\nFor example, here is a strange Python script that does not do anything useful, but consumes some real resources while running:\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\n\nimport\n \ntime\n\n\nimport\n \nos\n\n\nsize\n \n=\n \n1000000\n\n\nnumbers\n \n=\n \n[]\n\n\nfor\n \ni\n \nin\n \nxrange\n(\nsize\n):\n \nnumbers\n.\nappend\n(\nstr\n(\ni\n))\n\n\ntempfile\n \n=\n \nopen\n(\ntemp\n,\n \nw\n)\n\n\ntempfile\n.\nwrite\n(\n \n.\njoin\n(\nnumbers\n))\n\n\ntempfile\n.\nclose\n()\n\n\ntime\n.\nsleep\n(\n60\n)\n\n\nos\n.\nremove\n(\ntemp\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout trying to figure out what this code does or how many resources it uses, just create a submit file for it, and run it once with HTCondor, starting with somewhat high memory requests (\"1GB\" for memory and disk is a good starting point, unless you think the job will use far more, and will still match quickly). When it is done, examine the log file. In particular, we care about these lines:\n\n\n    Partitionable Resources :    \nem\nUsage\n/em\n  Request Allocated\n       Cpus                 :                 1         1\n       Disk (\nem\nKB\n/em\n)            :     \nem\n6739\n/em\n  1048576   8022934\n       Memory (\nem\nMB\n/em\n)          :        \nem\n3\n/em\n     1024      1024\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, now we know that the job used 6,739 KB of disk (= about 6.5 MB) and 3 MB of memory!\n\n\nThis is a great technique for determining the real resource needs of your job. If you think resource needs vary from run to run, submit a few sample jobs and look at all the results. And it never hurts to round up your resource requests a little, just in case your job occasionally uses more resources.\n\n\nSetting Resource Requirements\n\n\nOnce you know your job\u2019s resource requirements, it is easy to declare them in your submit file. For example, taking our results above as an example, we might slightly increase our requests above what was used, just to be safe:\n\n\nrequest_memory = 4MB  \nspan\n \nstyle=\nfont-style: italic; color: blue;\n# rounded up from 3 MB\n/span\n\nrequest_disk = 7MB   \nspan\n \nstyle=\nfont-style: italic; color: blue;\n# rounded up from 6.5 MB\n/span\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPay close attention to units:\n\n\n\n\nWithout explicit units, \nrequest_memory\n is in MB (megabytes)\n\n\nWithout explicit units, \nrequest_disk\n is in KB (kilobytes)\n\n\nAllowable units are \nKB\n (kilobytes), \nMB\n (megabytes), \nGB\n (gigabytes), and \nTB\n (terabytes)\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor translates these requirements into expressions that become part of the \nrequirements\n expression. However, do not put your CPU, memory, and disk requirements directly into the \nrequirements\n expression; use the \nrequest_\ni\nXXX\n/i\n statements instead.\n\n\nAdd these requirements to your submit file for the Python script, rerun the job, and confirm in the log file that your requests were used.",

For Disk: Determining disk needs may be a bit simpler, because you can check on the size of files that a program is using while it runs.

HTCondor counts  everything  in your job sandbox toward your job\u2019s disk usage:   The executable itself  All \"input\" files (anything else that gets transferred TO the job, even if you don't think of it as \"input\")  All files created during the job (broadly defined as \"output\"), including the captured standard output and error files that you list in the submit file.  All temporary files created in the sandbox, even if they get deleted by the executable before it's done.   If you can run your program within a single directory on a local computer (not on the submit server), you should be able to view files and their sizes with the  ls  command.",

The downside is that you'll have to watch a program run for essentially the entire time, to make sure you catch the maximum memory usage."

For example, here is a strange Python script that does not do anything useful, but consumes some real resources while running:  #!/usr/bin/env python  import   time  import   os  size   =   1000000  numbers   =   []  for   i   in   xrange ( size ):   numbers . append ( str ( i ))  tempfile   =   open ( temp ,   w )  tempfile . write (   . join ( numbers ))  tempfile . close ()  time . sleep ( 60 )  os . remove ( temp )   Without trying to figure out what this code does or how many resources it uses, just create a submit file for it, and run it once with HTCondor, starting with somewhat high memory requests (\"1GB\" for memory and disk is a good starting point, unless you think the job will use far more, and will still match quickly). When it is done, examine the log file. In particular, we care about these lines:      Partitionable Resources :     em Usage /em   Request Allocated\n       Cpus                 :                 1         1\n       Disk ( em KB /em )            :      em 6739 /em   1048576   8022934\n       Memory ( em MB /em )          :         em 3 /em      1024      1024  So, now we know that the job used 6,739 KB of disk (= about 6.5 MB) and 3 MB of memory!  This is a great technique for determining the real resource needs of your job. If you think resource needs vary from run to run, submit a few sample jobs and look at all the results. And it never hurts to round up your resource requests a little, just in case your job occasionally uses more resources.",

To list just the jobs associated with a single cluster number:\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncondor_q \nem\ni\nCLUSTER\n/i\n/em\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if you want to see the jobs in cluster 5678 (i.e., \n5678.0\n, \n5678.1\n, etc.), you use \ncondor_q 5678\n.\n\n\nTo list a specific job (i.e., cluster.process, as in 5678.0):\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncondor_q \nem\ni\nJOB_ID\n/i\n/em\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, to see job ID 5678.1, you use \ncondor_q 5678.1\n.\n\n\nNote:\n You can name more than one cluster, job ID, or combination thereof on the command line, in which case jobs for \nall\n of the named clusters and/or job IDs are listed.\n\n\nLet\u2019s get some practice using \ncondor_q\n selections!\n\n\n\n\nUsing a previous exercise, submit several \nsleep\n jobs\n\n\nList all jobs in the queue \u2014 are there others besides your own?\n\n\nPractice using all forms of \ncondor_q\n that you have learned:\n\n\nList just your jobs, with and without batching\n\n\nList a specific cluster\n\n\nList a specific job ID\n\n\nTry listing several users at once\n\n\nTry listing several clusters and job IDs at once\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen there are a variety of jobs in the queue, try combining a user ID and a different user's cluster or job ID in the same command \u2014 what happens?\n\n\n\n\nViewing a Job ClassAd\n\n\nYou may have wondered why it is useful to be able to list a single job ID using \ncondor_q\n. By itself, it may not be that useful. But, in combination with another option, it is very useful!\n\n\nIf you add the \n-long\n option to \ncondor_q\n (or its short form, \n-l\n), it will show the complete ClassAd for each selected job, instead of the one-line summary that you have seen so far. Because job ClassAds may have 80\u201390 attributes (or more), it probably makes the most sense to show the ClassAd for a single job at a time. And you know how to show just one job! Here is what the command looks like:\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncondor_q -long \nem\njob-id\n/em\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output from this command is long and complex. Most of the attributes that HTCondor adds to a job are arcane and uninteresting for us now. But here are some examples of common, interesting attributes taken directly from \ncondor_q\n output (except with some line breaks added to the \nRequirements\n attribute):\n\n\nMyType = \nJob\n\nErr = \nsleep.err\n\nUserLog = \n/home/cat/1-monday-2.1-queue/sleep.log\n\nJobUniverse = 5\nRequirements = ( IsOSGSchoolSlot =?= true ) \n\n        ( TARGET.Arch == \nX86_64\n ) \n\n        ( TARGET.OpSys == \nLINUX\n ) \n\n        ( TARGET.Disk \n= RequestDisk ) \n\n        ( TARGET.Memory \n= RequestMemory ) \n\n        ( TARGET.HasFileTransfer )\nClusterId = 2420\nWhenToTransferOutput = \nON_EXIT\n\nOwner = \ncat\n\nCondorVersion = \n$CondorVersion: 8.5.5 May 03 2016 BuildID: 366162 $\n\nOut = \nsleep.out\n\nCmd = \n/bin/sleep\n\nArguments = \n120\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Attributes are listed in no particular order and may change from time to time. Do not assume anything about the order of attributes in \ncondor_q\n output.\n\n\nSee what you can find in a job ClassAd from your own job.\n\n\n\n\nUsing a previous exercise, submit a \nsleep\n job\n\n\nBefore the job executes, capture its ClassAd and save to a file:\\ \n \ncondor_q -l \njob-id\n \n classad-1.txt\n\n\nAfter the job starts execution but before it finishes, capture its ClassAd again and save to a file:\\ \n \ncondor_q -l \njob-id\n \n classad-2.txt\n\n\n\n\nNow examine each saved ClassAd file. Here are a few things to look for:\n\n\n\n\nCan you find attributes that came from your submit file? (E.g., JobUniverse, Cmd, Arguments, Out, Err, UserLog, and so forth)\n\n\nCan you find attributes that could have come from your submit file, but that HTCondor added for you? (E.g., Requirements)\n\n\nHow many of the following attributes can you guess the meaning of?\n\n\nDiskUsage\n\n\nImageSize\n\n\nBytesSent\n\n\nJobStartDate \u2014 what format is the value in? (Hint: The HTCondor developers are primarily trained in the Unix way of doing things.)\n\n\nJobStatus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Is My Job Not Running?\n\n\nSometimes, you submit a job and it just sits in the queue in Idle state, never running. It can be difficult to figure out why a job never matches and runs. Fortunately, HTCondor can give you some help.\n\n\nTo ask HTCondor why you job is not running, add the \n-better-analyze\n option to \ncondor_q\n for the specific job. For example, for job ID 2423.0, the command is:\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncondor_q -better-analyze \nem\n2423.0\n/em\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, replace the job ID with your own.\n\n\nLet\u2019s submit a job that will never run and see what happens. Here is the submit file to use:\n\n\nuniverse = vanilla\nexecutable = /bin/hostname\noutput = norun.out\nerror = norun.err\nlog = norun.log\nshould_transfer_files = YES\nwhen_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT\nrequest_memory = 2TB\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\n(Do you see what I did?)\n\n\n\n\nSave and submit this file\n\n\nRun \ncondor_q -analyze\n on the job ID\n\n\n\n\nThere is a lot of output, but a few items are worth highlighting. Here is a sample from my own job (with many lines left out):\n\n\n-- Submitter: learn.chtc.wisc.edu : ....\n...\n---\n2423.000:  Run analysis summary.  \nem\nOf 12388 machines,\n/em\n\n\nem\n   12388 are rejected by your job\ns requirements \n/em\n\n...\nWARNING:  Be advised:\n\nem\n   No resources matched request\ns constraints\n/em\n\n\nThe Requirements expression for your job is:\n...\n\nSuggestions:\n\n    Condition                         Machines Matched    Suggestion\n    ---------                         ----------------    ----------\n\nem\n1   ( TARGET.Memory \n= 2097152 )      0                   MODIFY TO 1000064\n/em\n\n2   ( ... )\n                                      12145                \n3   ( TARGET.Arch == \nX86_64\n )       12388                \n4   ( TARGET.OpSys == \nLINUX\n )       12386                \n5   ( TARGET.Disk \n= 20 )             12387                \n6   ( TARGET.HasFileTransfer )        12388                \n\n\n\n\n\nToward the top, \ncondor_q\n said that it considered 12388 \u201cmachines\u201d (really, slots) and \nall\n 12388 of them were rejected by \nmy job\u2019s requirements\n. In other words, I am asking for something that is not available. But what?\n\n\nThe real clue comes from the breakdown of the Requirements expression, at the end of the output. Note the highlighted line: My job asked for \n2 terabytes\n of memory (2,097,152 MB) and \nno\n machines matched that part of the expression. Well, of course! 2 TB is a lot of memory on today\u2019s machines. And finally, note the suggestion: If I reduce my memory request to 1,000,064 MB (about 1 TB), there will be at least one slot in the pool that will match that expression.\n\n\nThe output from \ncondor_q -analyze\n (and \ncondor_q -better-analyze\n) may be helpful or it may not be, depending on your exact case. The example above was constructed so that it would be obvious what the problem was. But in many cases, this is a good place to start looking if you are having problems matching.\n\n\nAutomatic Formatting Output (Optional)\n\n\nThere is a way to format output from \ncondor_q\n with the \n-autoformat\n or \n-af\n option. In this case, HTCondor decides for you how to format the data you ask for from job ClassAd(s). (To tell HTCondor how to format this information, yourself, you could use the \n-format\n option, which we're not covering.)\n\n\nTo use autoformatting, use the \n-af\n option followed by the attribute name, for each attribute that you want to output:\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncondor_q -af Owner -af ClusterId -af Cmd\n/strong\n\n\nmoate 2418 /share/test.sh\n\n\ncat 2421 /bin/sleep\n\n\ncat 2422 /bin/sleep\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the \n-af\n option saves some typing but provides less control over the formatting of the output.\n\n\nBonus Question\n: If you wanted to print out the \nRequirements\n expression of a job, how would you do that with \n-af\n? Is the output what you expected? (HINT: for ClassAd attributes like \"Requirements\" that are long expressions, instead of simple values, you can use \n-af:r\n to view the expressions, instead of what it's current evaluation.)\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nAs suggested above, if you want to learn more about \ncondor_q\n, you can do some reading:\n\n\n\n\nRead the \ncondor_q\n man page or HTCondor Manual section (same text) to learn about more options\n\n\nRead about ClassAd attributes in Appendix A of the HTCondor Manual",

You've already learned the basic \ncondor_status\n and the \ncondor_status -compact\n variation (which you may wish to retry now, before proceeding).\n\n\nAnother convenient option is to list only those slots that are available now:\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncondor_status -avail\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, the individual execute machines only report their slots to the collector at certain time intervals, so this list will not reflect the up-to-the-second reality of all slots. But this limitation is true of all \ncondor_status\n output, not just with the \n-avail\n option.\n\n\nSimilar to \ncondor_q\n, you can limit the slots that are listed in two easy ways. To list just the slots on a specific machine:\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncondor_status \nem\ni\nHOSTNAME\n/i\n/em\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if you want to see the slots on \ne242.chtc.wisc.edu\n (in the CHTC pool):\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncondor_status e242.chtc.wisc.edu\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo list a specific slot on a machine:\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncondor_status \nem\ni\nSLOT\n/i\n/em\n@\nem\ni\nHOSTNAME\n/i\n/em\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, to see the \u201cfirst\u201d slot on the machine above:\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncondor_status slot1@e242.chtc.wisc.edu\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n You can name more than one hostname, slot, or combination thereof on the command line, in which case slots for \nall\n of the named hostnames and/or slots are listed.\n\n\nLet\u2019s get some practice using \ncondor_status\n selections!\n\n\n\n\nList all slots in the pool \u2014 how many are there total?\n\n\nPractice using all forms of \ncondor_status\n that you have learned:\n\n\nList the available slots\n\n\nList the slots on a specific machine (e.g., \ne242.chtc.wisc.edu\n)\n\n\nList a specific slot from that machine\n\n\nTry listing the slots from a few (but not all) machines at once\n\n\nTry using a mix of hostnames and slot IDs at once\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViewing a Slot ClassAd\n\n\nJust as with \ncondor_q\n, you can use \ncondor_status\n to view the complete ClassAd for a given slot (often confusingly called the \u201cmachine\u201d ad):\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncondor_status -long \nem\ni\nSLOT\n/i\n/em\n@\nem\ni\nHOSTNAME\n/i\n/em\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause slot ClassAds may have 150\u2013200 attributes (or more), it probably makes the most sense to show the ClassAd for a single slot at a time, as shown above.\n\n\nHere are some examples of common, interesting attributes taken directly from \ncondor_status\n output:\n\n\nOpSys = \nLINUX\n\nDetectedCpus = 24\nOpSysAndVer = \nSL6\n\nMyType = \nMachine\n\nLoadAvg = 0.99\nTotalDisk = 798098404\nOSIssue = \nScientific Linux release 6.6 (Carbon)\n\nTotalMemory = 24016\nMachine = \ne242.chtc.wisc.edu\n\nCondorVersion = \n$CondorVersion: 8.5.5 May 03 2016 BuildID: 366162 $\n\nMemory = 1024\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you may be able to tell, there is a mix of attributes about the machine as a whole (hence the name \u201cmachine ad\u201d) and about the slot in particular.\n\n\nGo ahead and examine a machine ClassAd now. I suggest looking at one of the slots on, say, \nc010.chtc.wisc.edu\n because of its relatively simple configuration.\n\n\nViewing Slots by ClassAd Expression\n\n\nOften, it is helpful to view slots that meet some particular criteria. For example, if you know that your job needs a lot of memory to run, you may want to see how many high-memory slots there are and whether they are busy. You can filter the list of slots like this using the \n-constraint\n option and a ClassAd expression.\n\n\nFor example, suppose we want to list all slots that are running Scientific Linux 6 (operating system) and have at least 16 GB memory available. Note that memory is reported in units of Megabytes. The command is:\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncondor_status -constraint \nOpSysAndVer == \nSL6\n \n Memory \n= 64000\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Be very careful with using quote characters appropriately in these commands. In the example above, the single quotes (\n'\n) are for the shell, so that the entire expression is passed to \ncondor_status\n untouched, and the double quotes (\n\"\n) surround a string value within the expression itself.\n\n\nCurrently on CHTC, there are only a few slots that meet these criteria.\n\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about writing ClassAd expressions, look at section 4.1 and especially 4.1.4 of the HTCondor Manual. This is definitely advanced material, so if you do not want to read it, that is fine. But if you do, take some time to practice writing expressions for the \ncondor_status -constraint\n command.\n\n\nNote:\n The \ncondor_q\n command accepts the \n-constraint\n option as well! As you might expect, the option allows you to limit the jobs that are listed based on a ClassAd expression.\n\n\nFormatting Output (Optional)\n\n\nThe \ncondor_status\n command accepts the same \n-format\n (\n-f\n) and \n-autoformat\n (\n-af\n) options that \ncondor_q\n accepts, and the options have the same meanings in both commands. Of course, the attributes available in machine ads may differ from the ones that are available in job ads. Use the HTCondor Manual or look at individual slot ClassAds to get a better idea of what attributes are available.\n\n\nFor example, I was curious about the Windows slot listed in the \ncondor_status\n summary output. Here are two commands that show the full hostnames and major version information for the Windows slots:\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncondor_status -format \n%30s  \n Machine -format \n%s\\n\n OpSysAndVer -constraint \nOpSys == \nWINDOWS\n/strong\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncondor_status -af Machine -af OpSysAndVer -constraint \nOpSys == \nWINDOWS\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you like, spend a few minutes now or later experimenting with \ncondor_status\n formatting.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nAs suggested above, if you want to learn more about \ncondor_q\n, you can do some reading:\n\n\n\n\nRead the \ncondor_status\n man page or HTCondor Manual section (same text) to learn about more options\n\n\nRead about ClassAd attributes in Appendix A of the HTCondor Manual\n\n\nRead about ClassAd expressions in section 4.1.4 of the HTCondor Manual",

This small change significantly adds to the kinds of jobs that you can run.\n\n\nViewing a Job Sandbox\n\n\nBefore you learn to transfer files to and from your job, it is good to understand a bit more about the environment in which your job runs. When the HTCondor \nstarter\n process prepares to run your job, it creates a new directory for your job and all of its files. We call this directory the \njob sandbox\n, because it is your job\u2019s private space to play. Let\u2019s see what is in the job sandbox for a very simple job with no special input or output files.\n\n\n\n\nSave the script below in a file named \nsandbox.sh\n:\\ \n#/bin/sh\n\n\n\n\necho 'Date: ' `date` echo 'Host: ' `hostname` echo 'System: ' `uname -spo` echo 'OS info: ' `cat /etc/redhat-release` echo 'Sandbox: ' `pwd` echo ls -alF\n\n\n\n\nCreate a submit file for this script and submit it\n\n\nWhen the job finishes, look at the contents of the output file\n\n\n\n\nIn the output file, note the \nSandbox:\n line: That is the full path to your job sandbox for the run. It was created just for your job, and it was removed as soon as your job finished.\n\n\nNext, look at the output that appears after the \nSandbox:\n line; it is the output from the \nls\n command in the script. It shows all of the files in your job sandbox, as they existed at the end of the execution of \nsandbox.sh\n. The files are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.chirp.config\n\n\nConfiguration for an advanced feature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.job.ad\n\n\nThe job ClassAd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.machine.ad\n\n\nThe machine ClassAd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_condor_stderr\n\n\nSaved standard error from the job\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_condor_stdout\n\n\nSaved standard output from the job\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncondor_exec.exe\n\n\nThe executable, renamed from \nsandbox.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntmp/\n\n\nA directory in which to put temporary files\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, HTCondor wrote copies of the job and machine ads (for use by the job, if desired), transferred your executable (\nsandbox.sh\n), renamed it (\ncondor_exec.exe\n), ran it, and saved its standard output and standard error into files. Notice that your submit file, which was in the same directory on the submit machine as your executable, was \nnot\n transferred, nor were any other files that happened to be in directory with the submit file.\n\n\nNow that we know something about the sandbox, we can transfer more files to and from it.\n\n\nRunning a Job With Input Files\n\n\nNext, you will run a job that requires an input file. As with all previous examples, you will tell HTCondor to transfer files to the sandbox (=should_transfer_files = YES=). Remember, the initial job sandbox contains only the renamed job executable and nothing else from your directory on the submit machine. You must tell HTCondor explicitly about every other file to transfer to the sandbox. Fortunately, this is easy.\n\n\nHere is a simple Python script that takes the name of an input file (containing one word per line) from the command line, counts the number of times each (lowercased) word occurs in the text, and prints out the final list of words and their counts.\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\n\n\nimport\n \nos\n\n\nimport\n \nsys\n\n\n\nif\n \nlen\n(\nsys\n.\nargv\n)\n \n!=\n \n2\n:\n\n    \nprint\n \nUsage: \n%s\n DATA\n \n%\n \n(\nos\n.\npath\n.\nbasename\n(\nsys\n.\nargv\n[\n0\n]))\n\n    \nsys\n.\nexit\n(\n1\n)\n\n\ninput_filename\n \n=\n \nsys\n.\nargv\n[\n1\n]\n\n\n\nwords\n \n=\n \n{}\n\n\n\nmy_file\n \n=\n \nopen\n(\ninput_filename\n,\n \nr\n)\n\n\nfor\n \nline\n \nin\n \nmy_file\n:\n\n    \nword\n \n=\n \nline\n.\nstrip\n()\n.\nlower\n()\n\n    \nif\n \nword\n \nin\n \nwords\n:\n\n        \nwords\n[\nword\n]\n \n+=\n \n1\n\n    \nelse\n:\n\n        \nwords\n[\nword\n]\n \n=\n \n1\n\n\nmy_file\n.\nclose\n()\n\n\n\nfor\n \nword\n \nin\n \nsorted\n(\nwords\n.\nkeys\n()):\n\n    \nprint\n \n%8d\n \n%s\n \n%\n \n(\nwords\n[\nword\n],\n \nword\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave the Python script in a file named \nfreq.py\n\n\nDownload the input file for the script (263K lines, ~1.4 MB) and save it in your submit directory:\\ \n \nwget \nhttp://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/osgschool16/mon-3.2-words.txt\n\n\nCreate a basic submit file for the \nfreq.py\n executable\n\n\nAdd a line to tell HTCondor to transfer the input file:\\ \ntransfer_input_files = mon-3.2-words.txt\n\\ \nAs with all submit file commands, it does not matter where this line goes. I usually group it with the other file transfer commands.\n\n\nDo not forget to add a line to name the input file as the argument to the Python script\n\n\nSubmit the job, wait for it to finish, and check the output!\n\n\n\n\nIf things do not work the first time, keep trying! At this point in the exercises, we are telling you less and less explicitly how to do steps that you have done before. If you get stuck, ask a neighbor or one of the instructors.\n\n\nNote:\n If you want to transfer more than one input file, list all of them on a single \ntransfer_input_files\n command, separated by commas. For example, if there are three input files:\n\n\ntransfer_input_files = a.txt, b.txt, c.txt\n\n\n\n\n\nExtra Challenge\n\n\nMany standard command-line program operate on input files. For example, the \ncat\n command can takes one or more input files as arguments, printing to standard output each file in order. Other common commands that take input files as arguments are \ngrep\n, \ndiff\n, and \nsort\n.\n\n\nUsing commands like these, or others that you know and that are readily available, create one or more submit files that take input files and produce output. If you are using a command that is \nnot\n contained in your submit directory, be sure to put its complete path in your \nexecutable\n line; use the \nwhich\n command to find the paths of standard programs. Also be sure to set the \narguments\n line correctly for each program.\n\n\nTransferring Output Files\n\n\nSo far, we have relied on programs that send their output to the standard output and error streams, which HTCondor captures, saves, and returns back to the submit directory. But what if your program writes one or more files for its output? How do you tell HTCondor to bring them back?\n\n\nLet\u2019s start by exploring what happens to files that a jobs creates in the sandbox. We will use a very simple method for creating a new file: We will copy an input file to another name.\n\n\n\n\nFind or create a small input file (it is fine to use any small file from a previous exercise)\n\n\nCreate a submit file that transfers the input file and copies it to another name (as if doing \n/bin/cp input.txt output.txt\n on the command line)\n\n\nMake the output filename different than any filenames that are in your submit directory\n\n\nWhat is the \nexecutable\n line?\n\n\nWhat is the \narguments\n line?\n\n\nHow do you tell HTCondor to transfer the input file?\n\n\nAs always, use \noutput\n, \nerror\n, and \nlog\n filenames that are different from previous exercises\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the job and wait for it to finish\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened? Can you tell what HTCondor did with your output file, after it was created in the job sandbox? Look carefully at the list of files in your submit directory now\u2026\n\n\nTransferring Specific Output Files\n\n\nAs you saw in the last exercise, by default HTCondor transfers files that are created in the job sandbox back to the submit directory when the job finishes. In fact, HTCondor will also transfer back \nchanged\n input files, too. But, this only works for files that are in the top-level sandbox directory, and \nnot\n for ones contained in subdirectories.\n\n\nWhat if you want to bring back only \nsome\n output files, or output files contained in subdirectories?\n\n\nHere is a simple shell script that creates several files, including a copy of an input file in a new subdirectory:\n\n\n#!/bin/sh\n\n\nif\n \n[\n \n$#\n -ne \n1\n \n]\n;\n \nthen\n \necho\n \nUsage: \n$0\n INPUT\n;\n \nexit\n \n1\n;\n \nfi\n\ndate \n output-timestamp.txt\ncal \n output-calendar.txt\nmkdir subdirectory\ncp \n$1\n subdirectory/backup-\n$1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, let\u2019s confirm that HTCondor does not bring back the output file in the subdirectory:\n\n\n\n\nSave the shell script in a file named \noutput.sh\n\n\nWrite a submit file that transfers an input file and runs \noutput.sh\n on it\n\n\nSubmit the job, wait for it to finish, and examine the contents of your submit directory\n\n\n\n\nSuppose you decide that you want only the timestamp output file and all files in the subdirectory, but not the calendar output file. You can tell HTCondor to transfer these specific files:\n\n\ntransfer_output_files = output-timestamp.txt, subdirectory/\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n See the trailing slash (\n/\n) on the subdirectory? That tells HTCondor to transfer back \nthe files\n contained in the subdirectory, but not the directory itself; the files will be written directly into the submit directory itself. If you want HTCondor to transfer back an entire directory, leave off the trailing slash.\n\n\n\n\nRemove all output files from the previous run, including \noutput-timestamp.txt\n and \noutput-calendar.txt\n\n\nCopy the previous submit file that ran \noutput.sh\n and add the \ntransfer_output_files\n line from above\n\n\nSubmit the job, wait for it to finish, and examine the contents of your submit directory\n\n\n\n\nDid it work as you expected?\n\n\nThinking About Progress So Far\n\n\nAt this point, you can do just about everything that you need in order to run jobs on a local HTC pool. You can identify the executable, arguments, and input files, and you can get output back from the job. This is a big achievement!\n\n\nIn some ways, everything after this exercise just makes it easier to run certain kinds of jobs and deal with certain kinds of situations.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nThere are many more details about HTCondor\u2019s file transfer mechanism not covered here.

When the HTCondor  starter  process prepares to run your job, it creates a new directory for your job and all of its files. We call this directory the  job sandbox , because it is your job\u2019s private space to play. Let\u2019s see what is in the job sandbox for a very simple job with no special input or output files.   Save the script below in a file named  sandbox.sh :\\  #/bin/sh   echo 'Date: ' `date` echo 'Host: ' `hostname` echo 'System: ' `uname -spo` echo 'OS info: ' `cat /etc/redhat-release` echo 'Sandbox: ' `pwd` echo ls -alF   Create a submit file for this script and submit it  When the job finishes, look at the contents of the output file   In the output file, note the  Sandbox:  line: That is the full path to your job sandbox for the run. It was created just for your job, and it was removed as soon as your job finished.  Next, look at the output that appears after the  Sandbox:  line; it is the output from the  ls  command in the script. It shows all of the files in your job sandbox, as they existed at the end of the execution of  sandbox.sh . The files are:           .chirp.config  Configuration for an advanced feature    .job.ad  The job ClassAd    .machine.ad  The machine ClassAd    _condor_stderr  Saved standard error from the job    _condor_stdout  Saved standard output from the job    condor_exec.exe  The executable, renamed from  sandbox.sh    tmp/  A directory in which to put temporary files     So, HTCondor wrote copies of the job and machine ads (for use by the job, if desired), transferred your executable ( sandbox.sh ), renamed it ( condor_exec.exe ), ran it, and saved its standard output and standard error into files. Notice that your submit file, which was in the same directory on the submit machine as your executable, was  not  transferred, nor were any other files that happened to be in directory with the submit file.

You must tell HTCondor explicitly about every other file to transfer to the sandbox. Fortunately, this is easy.  Here is a simple Python script that takes the name of an input file (containing one word per line) from the command line, counts the number of times each (lowercased) word occurs in the text, and prints out the final list of words and their counts.  #!/usr/bin/env python  import   os  import   sys  if   len ( sys . argv )   !=   2 : \n     print   Usage:  %s  DATA   %   ( os . path . basename ( sys . argv [ 0 ])) \n     sys . exit ( 1 )  input_filename   =   sys . argv [ 1 ]  words   =   {}  my_file   =   open ( input_filename ,   r )  for   line   in   my_file : \n     word   =   line . strip () . lower () \n     if   word   in   words : \n         words [ word ]   +=   1 \n     else : \n         words [ word ]   =   1  my_file . close ()  for   word   in   sorted ( words . keys ()): \n     print   %8d   %s   %   ( words [ word ],   word )    Save the Python script in a file named  freq.py  Download the input file for the script (263K lines, ~1.4 MB) and save it in your submit directory:\\    wget  http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/osgschool16/mon-3.2-words.txt  Create a basic submit file for the  freq.py  executable  Add a line to tell HTCondor to transfer the input file:\\  transfer_input_files = mon-3.2-words.txt \\  As with all submit file commands, it does not matter where this line goes.

(Historical note: Programmers like to start counting from 0, hence the odd numbering scheme.)\n\n\nAt this time, it is worth reviewing the definition of a \njob ID\n. It is a job\u2019s cluster number, a dot (\n.\n), and the job\u2019s process number. So in the example above, the job ID of the second job is \n10228.1\n.\n\n\nPop Quiz:\n Do you remember how to ask HTCondor to list all of the jobs from one cluster? How about one specific job ID?\n\n\nUsing queue \nN\n With Output\n\n\nWhen all three jobs in your single cluster are finished, examine the resulting files.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is in the output file?\n\n\nWhat is in the error file (hopefully nothing)?\n\n\nWhat is in the log file? Look carefully at the job IDs in each event.\n\n\nIs this what you expected? Is it what you wanted?\n\n\n\n\nUsing $(Process) to Distinguish Jobs\n\n\nAs you saw with the experiment above, we need a way to separate output (and error) files \nper job that is queued\n, not just for the whole cluster of jobs. Fortunately, HTCondor has a way to separate the files easily.\n\n\nWhen processing a submit file, HTCondor defines and uses a special variable for the process number of each job. If you write \n$(Process)\n in a submit file, HTCondor will replace it with the process number of the job, independently for each job that is queued. For example, you can use the \n$(Process)\n variable to define a separate output file name for each job. Suppose the following two lines are in a submit file:\n\n\noutput = my-output-file-$(Process).out\nqueue 10\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though the \noutput\n filename is defined only once, HTCondor will create separate output filenames for each job:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst job\n\n\nmy-output-file-0.out\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond job\n\n\nmy-output-file-1.out\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThird job\n\n\nmy-output-file-2.out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast (tenth) job\n\n\nmy-output-file-9.out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s see how this works for our program that estimates \u03c0.\n\n\n\n\nIn your submit file, change the definitions of \noutput\n and \nerror\n to use \n$(Process)\n, in a way that is similar to the example above\n\n\nRemove any output, error, and log files from previous runs\n\n\nSubmit the updated file\n\n\n\n\nWhen all three jobs are finished, examine the resulting files again.\n\n\n\n\nHow many files are there of each type? What are their names?\n\n\nIs this what you expected? Is it what you wanted from the \u03c0 estimation process?\n\n\n\n\nUsing $(Cluster) to Separate Files Across Runs\n\n\nWith \n$(Process)\n, you can get separate output (and error) filenames for each job within a run. However, the next time you submit the same file, all of the output and error files are overwritten by new ones created by the new jobs. Maybe this is the behavior that you want. But sometimes, you may want to separate files by run, as well.\n\n\nIn addition to \n$(Process)\n, there is also a \n$(Cluster)\n variable that you can use in your submit files. It works just like \n$(Process)\n, except it is replaced with the cluster number of the entire submission. Because the cluster number is the same for all jobs within a single submission, it does not separate files by job within a submission. But when used \nwith\n \n$(Process)\n, it can be used to separate files by run. For example, consider this \noutput\n statement:\n\n\noutput = my-output-file-$(Cluster)-$(Process).out\n\n\n\n\n\nFor one particular run, it might result in output filenames like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst job\n\n\nmy-output-file-2444-0.out\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond job\n\n\nmy-output-file-2444-1.out\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThird job\n\n\nmy-output-file-2444-2.out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you like, change your submit file from the previous exercise to use both \n$(Cluster)\n and \n$(Process)\n. Submit your file twice to see the separate files for each run. Be careful how many jobs you run total, as the number of output files grows quickly!\n\n\nUsing $(Process) and $(Cluster) in Other Statements\n\n\nThe \n$(Cluster)\n and \n$(Process)\n variables can be used in any submit file statement, although they are useful in some kinds of statements more than others. For instance, it is hard to imagine a truly good reason to use the \n$(Process)\n variable in a \nrank\n statement (i.e., for preferring some execute slots over others), and in general the \n$(Cluster)\n variable often makes little sense to use.\n\n\nBut in some situations, the \n$(Process)\n variable can be very helpful. Common uses are in the following kinds of statements \u2014 can you think of a scenario in which each use might be helpful?\n\n\n\n\nlog\n\n\ntransfer_input_files\n\n\ntransfer_output_files\n\n\narguments\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, HTCondor does not let you perform math on the \n$(Process)\n number when using it. So, for example, if you use \n$(Process)\n as a numeric argument to a command, it will always result in jobs getting the arguments 0, 1, 2, and so on. If you have control over your program and the way in which it uses command-line arguments, then you are fine. Otherwise, you might need to transform the \n$(Process)\n numbers into something more appropriate using a \nwrapper script\n, which will be discussed on Wednesday.\n\n\n(Optional) Defining JobBatchName for Tracking\n\n\nDuring the lecture, it was mentioned that you can define arbitrary attributes in your submit file, and that one purpose of such attributes is to track or report on different jobs separately. In this optional exercise, you will see how this technique can be used.\n\n\nOnce again, we will use \nsleep\n jobs, so that your jobs remain in the queue long enough to experiment on.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a basic submit file that runs \nsleep 120\n (or some reasonable duration).\n\n\nInstead of a single \nqueue\n statement, write this:\\ \n\n\n\n\njobbatchname = 1\n queue 5 \n\\ \nThe highlighted statements give the extra attribute \njobbatchname\n to your jobs; the first 5 jobs have one value, and the second 5 have another.\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the file.\n\n\nNow, quickly edit the submit file to instead say:\n\n\n\n\njobbatchname = 2\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the file again.\n\n\n\n\nCheck on the submissions using a normal \ncondor_q\n and \ncondor_q -nobatch\n. Of course, your special attribute does not appear in the \ncondor_q -nobatch\n output, but it is present in the \ncondor_q\n output and in each job\u2019s ClassAd. You can see the effect of the attribute by limiting your \ncondor_q\n output to one type of job or another. First, run this command:\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncondor_q -constraint \nJobBatchName == \n1\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you get the output that you expected?\n\n\nUsing the example command above, how would you list your other five jobs?",

If you write  $(Process)  in a submit file, HTCondor will replace it with the process number of the job, independently for each job that is queued. For example, you can use the  $(Process)  variable to define a separate output file name for each job. Suppose the following two lines are in a submit file:  output = my-output-file-$(Process).out\nqueue 10  Even though the  output  filename is defined only once, HTCondor will create separate output filenames for each job:           First job  my-output-file-0.out    Second job  my-output-file-1.out    Third job  my-output-file-2.out    ...

However, the next time you submit the same file, all of the output and error files are overwritten by new ones created by the new jobs. Maybe this is the behavior that you want. But sometimes, you may want to separate files by run, as well.  In addition to  $(Process) , there is also a  $(Cluster)  variable that you can use in your submit files. It works just like  $(Process) , except it is replaced with the cluster number of the entire submission. Because the cluster number is the same for all jobs within a single submission, it does not separate files by job within a submission. But when used  with   $(Process) , it can be used to separate files by run. For example, consider this  output  statement:  output = my-output-file-$(Cluster)-$(Process).out  For one particular run, it might result in output filenames like this:           First job  my-output-file-2444-0.out    Second job  my-output-file-2444-1.out    Third job  my-output-file-2444-2.out    ...

The focus of this exercise is to submit one job per filename that matches a given pattern.\n\n\nIn all cases of submitting many jobs from a single submit file, the key questions are:\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes each job unique? In other words, there is one job per ____\n_\n?\n\n\nWhat tells HTCondor how to distinguish each job?\n\n\n\n\nFor \nqueue \ni\nN\n/i\n, jobs are distinguished simply by number and HTCondor assigns the numbers itself. But with the remaining \nqueue\n forms, you help HTCondor distinguish jobs by other, more meaningful means.\n\n\nCounting Words in Files\n\n\nSuppose you have a collection of books, and you want to analyze how words vary from book to book or author to author. As mentioned in the lecture, HTCondor provides many ways to do this task. You could create a separate submit file for each book, and submit all of the files manually. Or you could be a bit more clever and create one submit file for all of the books: (DON'T ACTUALLY CREATE THIS SUBMIT FILE)\n\n\nuniverse                = vanilla\nexecutable              = freq.py\nrequest_memory          = 20MB\nrequest_disk          = 20MB\nshould_transfer_files   = YES\nwhen_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT\n\ntransfer_input_files = AAiW.txt\narguments            = \nquot;AAiW.txt\nquot;\noutput               = AAiW.out\nerror                = AAiW.err\nlog                  = AAiW.log\nqueue\n\ntransfer_input_files = PandP.txt\narguments            = \nquot;PandP.txt\nquot;\noutput               = PandP.out\nerror                = PandP.err\nlog                  = PandP.log\nqueue\n\ntransfer_input_files = TAoSH.txt\narguments            = \nquot;TAoSH.txt\nquot;\noutput               = TAoSH.out\nerror                = TAoSH.err\nlog                  = TAoSH.log\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use many \nqueue\n statements in one submit file, HTCondor remembers and carries over values for attributes, such as \nuniverse\n, \nexecutable\n, \nrequest_memory\n, and so on in this example.\n\n\nBut even then, this approach results in a long, repetitive submit file. And if you add more books, you must add five more lines to the submit file for each book. Therefore, this is not a recommended approach to submitting many jobs with one submit file. Fortunately, HTCondor has many \nqueue\n features to make this kind of job submission process easy!\n\n\nQueue Jobs By Matching Filenames\n\n\nFor our analysis, we will have a new version of the word-frequency counting script. It takes a single command-line argument, which is the name of the input file containing the text of a book, and it outputs the frequency of each word from least to most common. There will be several book files, and the filename for each book ends with \n.txt\n.\n\n\nThis is an example of a common scenario: We want to run one job per file, where the filenames match a certain consistent pattern. The \nqueue ... matching\n statement is made for this scenario.\n\n\nLet\u2019s see this in action. First, here is the new version of the script:\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\n\n\nimport\n \nos\n\n\nimport\n \nsys\n\n\nimport\n \noperator\n\n\n\nif\n \nlen\n(\nsys\n.\nargv\n)\n \n!=\n \n2\n:\n\n    \nprint\n \nUsage: \n%s\n DATA\n \n%\n \n(\nos\n.\npath\n.\nbasename\n(\nsys\n.\nargv\n[\n0\n]))\n\n    \nsys\n.\nexit\n(\n1\n)\n\n\ninput_filename\n \n=\n \nsys\n.\nargv\n[\n1\n]\n\n\n\nwords\n \n=\n \n{}\n\n\n\nmy_file\n \n=\n \nopen\n(\ninput_filename\n,\n \nr\n)\n\n\nfor\n \nline\n \nin\n \nmy_file\n:\n\n    \nline_words\n \n=\n \nline\n.\nsplit\n()\n\n    \nfor\n \nword\n \nin\n \nline_words\n:\n\n        \nif\n \nword\n \nin\n \nwords\n:\n\n            \nwords\n[\nword\n]\n \n+=\n \n1\n\n        \nelse\n:\n\n            \nwords\n[\nword\n]\n \n=\n \n1\n\n\nmy_file\n.\nclose\n()\n\n\n\nsorted_words\n \n=\n \nsorted\n(\nwords\n.\nitems\n(),\n \nkey\n=\noperator\n.\nitemgetter\n(\n1\n))\n\n\nfor\n \nword\n \nin\n \nsorted_words\n:\n\n    \nprint\n \n%s\n \n%8d\n \n%\n \n(\nword\n[\n0\n],\n \nword\n[\n1\n])\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo use the script:\n\n\n\n\nSave it as \nwordcount.py\n\n\nDownload and unpack some books from Project Gutenberg:\\ \n\n\n\n\n \nwget \nhttp://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/osgschool17/books.zip\n \n \nunzip books.zip\n \n\n\n\n\nVerify the script by running it on one book manually\n\n\nCreate a submit file to submit one file (pick one), including memory and disk requests of 20\u00a0MB; submit it, if you like\n\n\nModify the following submit file statements to work for all books:\\ \n\n\n\n\ntransfer_input_files = $(BOOK) arguments = $(book) output = $(book).out error = $(book).err queue book matching *.txt \n\\ \nNote, as always, the order of statements in a submit file does not matter, except that the \nqueue\n statement should be last. Also note that any submit file variable name (here, \nbook\n, but true for \nprocess\n and all others) may be used in any mixture of upper- and lowercase letters.\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the jobs\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor uses the \nqueue ... matching\n statement to look for files in the submit directory that match the given pattern, then queues one job per match. For each job, the given variable (e.g., \nbook\n here) is assigned the name of the matching file, so that it can be used in \noutput\n, \nerror\n, and other statements.\n\n\nThe result is the same as if we had written out a much longer submit file:\n\n\n...\n\ntransfer_input_files = AAiW.txt\narguments = \nquot;AAiW.txt\nquot;\noutput = AAiW.txt.out\nerror = AAiW.txt.err\nqueue\n\ntransfer_input_files = PandP.txt\narguments = \nquot;PandP.txt\nquot;\noutput = PandP.txt.out\nerror = PandP.txt.err\nqueue\n\ntransfer_input_files = TAoSH.txt\narguments = \nquot;TAoSH.txt\nquot;\noutput = TAoSH.txt.out\nerror = TAoSH.txt.err\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is some sample \ncondor_q -nobatch\n output:\n\n\n ID      OWNER            SUBMITTED     RUN_TIME ST PRI SIZE CMD\n\n\n  89.0   iaross          7/17 11:41   0+00:00:00 I  0    0.0 wordcount.py AAiW.txt\n\n\n  89.1   iaross          7/17 11:41   0+00:00:00 I  0    0.0 wordcount.py PandP.txt\n\n\n  89.2   iaross          7/17 11:41   0+00:00:00 I  0    0.0 wordcount.py TAoSH.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll three jobs were part of cluster 89. The first filename that was matched in the queue statement resulted in a process ID of 0, the second match has a process ID of 1, and the third has a process ID of 2.\n\n\nWhen the three jobs finish, carefully look at the resulting files. Do they match your expectations? There should be a single log file, but three separate output files and three separate (and hopefully empty) error files, one for each job.\n\n\nExtra Challenge 1\n\n\nIn the example above, you used a single log file for all three jobs. HTCondor handles this situation with no problem; each job writes its events into the log file without getting in the way of other events and other jobs. But as you may have seen, it may be difficult for a person to understand the events for any particular job in the combined log file.\n\n\nCreate a new submit file that works just like the one above, except that each job writes its own log file.",

First, here is the new version of the script:  #!/usr/bin/env python  import   os  import   sys  import   operator  if   len ( sys . argv )   !=   2 : \n     print   Usage:  %s  DATA   %   ( os . path . basename ( sys . argv [ 0 ])) \n     sys . exit ( 1 )  input_filename   =   sys . argv [ 1 ]  words   =   {}  my_file   =   open ( input_filename ,   r )  for   line   in   my_file : \n     line_words   =   line . split () \n     for   word   in   line_words : \n         if   word   in   words : \n             words [ word ]   +=   1 \n         else : \n             words [ word ]   =   1  my_file . close ()  sorted_words   =   sorted ( words . items (),   key = operator . itemgetter ( 1 ))  for   word   in   sorted_words : \n     print   %s   %8d   %   ( word [ 0 ],   word [ 1 ])   To use the script:   Save it as  wordcount.py  Download and unpack some books from Project Gutenberg:\\      wget  http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/osgschool17/books.zip     unzip books.zip     Verify the script by running it on one book manually  Create a submit file to submit one file (pick one), including memory and disk requests of 20\u00a0MB; submit it, if you like  Modify the following submit file statements to work for all books:\\    transfer_input_files = $(BOOK) arguments = $(book) output = $(book).out error = $(book).err queue book matching *.txt  \\  Note, as always, the order of statements in a submit file does not matter, except that the  queue  statement should be last. Also note that any submit file variable name (here,  book , but true for  process  and all others) may be used in any mixture of upper- and lowercase letters.   Submit the jobs   HTCondor uses the  queue ... matching  statement to look for files in the submit directory that match the given pattern, then queues one job per match. For each job, the given variable (e.g.,  book  here) is assigned the name of the matching file, so that it can be used in  output ,  error , and other statements.  The result is the same as if we had written out a much longer submit file:  ...\n\ntransfer_input_files = AAiW.txt\narguments =  quot;AAiW.txt quot;\noutput = AAiW.txt.out\nerror = AAiW.txt.err\nqueue\n\ntransfer_input_files = PandP.txt\narguments =  quot;PandP.txt quot;\noutput = PandP.txt.out\nerror = PandP.txt.err\nqueue\n\ntransfer_input_files = TAoSH.txt\narguments =  quot;TAoSH.txt quot;\noutput = TAoSH.txt.out\nerror = TAoSH.txt.err\nqueue  Here is some sample  condor_q -nobatch  output:   ID      OWNER            SUBMITTED     RUN_TIME ST PRI SIZE CMD    89.0   iaross          7/17 11:41   0+00:00:00 I  0    0.0 wordcount.py AAiW.txt    89.1   iaross          7/17 11:41   0+00:00:00 I  0    0.0 wordcount.py PandP.txt    89.2   iaross          7/17 11:41   0+00:00:00 I  0    0.0 wordcount.py TAoSH.txt   All three jobs were part of cluster 89. The first filename that was matched in the queue statement resulted in a process ID of 0, the second match has a process ID of 1, and the third has a process ID of 2.  When the three jobs finish, carefully look at the resulting files. Do they match your expectations? There should be a single log file, but three separate output files and three separate (and hopefully empty) error files, one for each job.",

In the real world, we would probably just fix the program, but what if you cannot change the software? Unfortunately, this situation happens more often than we would like.\n\n\nBelow is a simple Python script that fails once in a while. We will not fix it, but use it to simulate a program that can fail and that we \ncannot\n fix.\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\n\n\n# murphy.py simulates a real program with real problems\n\n\nimport\n \nrandom\n\n\nimport\n \nsys\n\n\nimport\n \ntime\n\n\n\n# Create a random number seeded by system entropy\n\n\nr\n \n=\n \nrandom\n.\nSystemRandom\n()\n\n\n\n# One time in three, simulate a runtime error\n\n\nif\n \n(\nr\n.\nrandint\n(\n0\n,\n2\n)\n \n==\n \n0\n):\n\n    \n# intentionally print no output\n\n    \nsys\n.\nexit\n(\n15\n)\n\n\nelse\n:\n\n    \ntime\n.\nsleep\n(\n3\n)\n\n    \nprint\n \nAll work done correctly\n\n\n\n# By convention, zero exit code means success\n\n\nsys\n.\nexit\n(\n0\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if you are not a Python expert, you may be able to figure out what this program does.\n\n\nLet\u2019s see what happens when a program like this one is run in HTCondor.\n\n\n\n\nIn a new directory for this exercise, save the script above as \nmurphy.py\n\n\nWrite a submit file for the script; \nqueue 20\n instances of the job and be sure to ask for 20\u00a0MB of memory and disk\n\n\nSubmit the file and wait for the jobs to finish\n\n\n\n\nWhat output do you expect? What output did you get? If you are curious about the exit code from the job, it is saved in completed jobs in \ncondor_history\n in the \nExitCode\n attribute. The following command will show the \nExitCode\n for a given cluster of jobs:\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncondor_history \nem\nCLUSTERID\n/em\n -af ProcId ExitCode\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Be sure to replace \nCLUSTERID\n with your actual cluster ID)\n\n\nHow many of the jobs succeeded? How many failed?\n\n\nRetrying Failed Jobs\n\n\nNow let\u2019s see if we can solve the problem of jobs that fail once in a while. In this particular case, if HTCondor runs a failed job again, it has a good chance of succeeding. Not all failing jobs are like this, but in this case it is a reasonable assumption.\n\n\nFrom the lecture materials, implement the \nmax_retries\n feature to retry any job with a non-zero exit code up to 5 times, then resubmit the jobs. Did your change work?\n\n\nAfter the jobs have finished, examine the log file(s) to see what happened in detail. Did any jobs need to be restarted? Another way to see how many restarts there were is to look at the \nNumJobStarts\n attribute of a completed job with the \ncondor_history\n command, in the same way you looked at the \nExitCode\n attribute earlier. Does the number of retries seem correct? For those jobs which did need to be retried, what is their \nExitCode=; and what about the =ExitCode\n from earlier execution attempts?\n\n\nA (Too) Long Running Job\n\n\nSometimes, an ill-behaved job will get stuck in a loop and run forever, instead of exiting with a failure code. We can modify our Python program to simulate this kind of bad job with the following file:\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\n\n\n# murphy.py simulate a real program with real problems\n\n\nimport\n \nrandom\n\n\nimport\n \nsys\n\n\nimport\n \ntime\n\n\n\n# Create a random number seeded by system entropy\n\n\nr\n \n=\n \nrandom\n.\nSystemRandom\n()\n\n\n\n# One time in three, simulate an infinite loop\n\n\nif\n \n(\nr\n.\nrandint\n(\n0\n,\n2\n)\n \n==\n \n0\n):\n\n        \n# intentionally print no output\n\n        \ntime\n.\nsleep\n(\n3600\n)\n\n        \nsys\n.\nexit\n(\n15\n)\n\n\nelse\n:\n\n        \ntime\n.\nsleep\n(\n3\n)\n\n        \nprint\n \nAll work done correctly\n\n\n\n# By convention, zero exit code means success\n\n\nsys\n.\nexit\n(\n0\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, you may be able to figure out what this new program does.\n\n\n\n\nSave the script to a new file named \nmurphy2.py\n\n\nCopy your previous submit file to a new name and change the \nexecutable\n to \nmurphy2.py\n\n\nIf you like, submit the new file\u00a0\u2014 but after a while be sure to remove the whole cluster to clear out the \u201chung\u201d jobs.\n\n\nNow try to change the submit file to automatically remove any jobs that \nrun\n for more than one minute. You can make this change with just a single line in your submit file\\ \nperiodic_remove = (JobStatus == 2) \n (CurrentTime - EnteredCurrentStatus) \n 60\n\n\nSubmit the new file. Do the long running jobs get removed? What does \ncondor_history\n show for the cluster after all jobs are done?\n\n\n\n\nBonus Exercise\n\n\nIf you have time, edit your submit file so that instead of removing long running jobs, have HTCondor automatically put the long-running job on hold, and then automatically release it.",

Let\u2019s make pretty pictures!\n\n\nWe have a small program that draws pictures of the Mandelbrot set. You can \nread about the Mandelbrot set on Wikipedia\n, or you can simply appreciate the pretty pictures. It\u2019s a fractal.\n\n\nWe have a simple program that can draw the Mandelbrot set. It's called \ngoatbrot\n, and you can find it in \n/usr/local/bin/goatbrot\n.\n\n\nRunning goatbrot From the Command Line\n\n\nYou can generate the Mandelbrot set with two simple commands.\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a PPM image of the Mandelbrot set:\\ \n \n/usr/local/bin/goatbrot -i 1000 -o tile_000000_000000.ppm -c 0,0 -w 3 -s 1000,1000\n\n\nConvert the image to the JPEG format:\\ \n \nconvert tile_000000_000000.ppm mandel.jpg\n\n\n\n\nThe \ngoatbroat\n program takes several parameters. Let's break them down:\n\n\n\n\n-i 1000\n The number of iterations. Bigger numbers generate more accurate images but are slower to run.\n\n\n-o tile_000000_000000.ppm\n The output file to generate.\n\n\n-c 0,0\n The center point of the image. Here it is the point (0,0).\n\n\n-w 3\n The width of the image. Here is 3.\n\n\n-s 1000,1000\n The size of the final image. Here we generate a picture that is 1000 pixels wide and 1000 pixels tall.\n\n\n\n\nDividing the Work into Smaller Pieces\n\n\nThe Mandelbrot set can take a while to create, particularly if you make the iterations large or the image size large. What if we broke the creation of the image into multiple invocations then stitched them together? Once we do that, we can run the each goatbroat in parallel in our cluster. Here's an example you can run by hand.\n\n\n\n\nRun goatbroat 4 times:\\ \n \n/usr/local/bin/goatbrot -i 1000 -o tile_000000_000000.ppm -c -0.75,0.75 -w 1.5 -s 500,500\n\n\n\n\n \n/usr/local/bin/goatbrot -i 1000 -o tile_000000_000001.ppm -c 0.75,0.75 -w 1.5 -s 500,500\n \n \n/usr/local/bin/goatbrot -i 1000 -o tile_000001_000000.ppm -c -0.75,-0.75 -w 1.5 -s 500,500\n \n \n/usr/local/bin/goatbrot -i 1000 -o tile_000001_000001.ppm -c 0.75,-0.75 -w 1.5 -s 500,500\n\n\n\n\nStitch them small images together into the complete image (in JPEG format):\\ \n \nmontage tile_000000_000000.ppm tile_000000_000001.ppm tile_000001_000000.ppm tile_000001_000001.ppm -mode Concatenate -tile 2x2 mandel.jpg\n\n\n\n\nThis will produce the same image as above. We divided the image space into a 2\u00d72 grid and ran \ngoatbrot\n on each section of the grid. The \nmontage\n program simply stitches the files together and writes out the final image in JPEG format.\n\n\nTry it!\n\n\nRun the commands above, make sure you can create the Mandelbrot image. When you create the image, you might wonder how you can view it. If you're comfortable with \nscp\n you can copy it back to your computer to view it. Otherwise you can view it in your web browser in three easy steps.\n\n\n\n\nMake your web directory (you only need to do this once):\\ \n \ncd ~\n\n\n\n\n \nmkdir ~/public_html\n \n \nchmod 0711 .\n \n \nchmod 0755 public_html\n\n\n\n\nCopy the image into your web directory:\\ \n \ncp mandel.jpg ~/public_html/\n\n\nAccess the URL below in your web browser (change \nUSER\n to your username on the submit machine):\\ \nhttp://learn.chtc.wisc.edu/\n~\nUSER\n/mandel.jpg",

After\nthe sweep runs, you need to collate the results.  This might look like this, assuming you want to sweep over five\nparameters:\n\n\n\n\nDAGMan has many abilities, such as throttling jobs, recovery from failures, and more.  More information about DAGMan can\nbe found at \nin the Condor manual\n.\n\n\nSubmitting a Simple DAG\n\n\nFor our job, we will return briefly to the \nsleep\n program.\n\n\nexecutable              = /bin/sleep\narguments               = 4\nlog                     = simple.log\noutput                  = simple.out\nerror                   = simple.error\nrequest_memory = 1GB\nrequest_disk       = 1GB\nrequest_cpus      = 1\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are going to get a bit more sophisticated in submitting our jobs now.  Let's have three windows open.  In one window,\nyou'll submit the job.  In another you will watch the queue, and in the third you will watch what DAGMan does.\n\n\nFirst we will create the most minimal DAG that can be created: a DAG with just one node.  Put this into a file named\n\nsimple.dag\n.\n\n\nJob Simple simple.sub\n\n\n\n\n\nIn your first window, submit the DAG:\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncondor_submit_dag

If you didn't read about it yet, \nplease do so now\n. We are going to make a DAG with four simultaneous jobs (\ngoatbrot\n) and one final node to stitch them together (\nmontage\n). This means we have five jobs. We're going to run \ngoatbrot\n with more iterations (100,000) so each job will take longer to run.\n\n\nYou can create your five jobs. The goatbrot jobs are very similar to each other, but they have slightly different parameters and output files.\n\n\ngoatbrot1.sub\n\n\nexecutable              = /usr/local/bin/goatbrot\narguments               = -i 100000 -c -0.75,0.75 -w 1.5 -s 500,500 -o tile_0_0.ppm\nlog                     = goatbrot.log\noutput                  = goatbrot.out.0.0\nerror                   = goatbrot.err.0.0\nrequest_memory = 1GB\nrequest_disk       = 1GB\nrequest_cpus      = 1\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\ngoatbrot2.sub\n\n\nexecutable              = /usr/local/bin/goatbrot\narguments               = -i 100000 -c 0.75,0.75 -w 1.5 -s 500,500 -o tile_0_1.ppm\nlog                     = goatbrot.log\noutput                  = goatbrot.out.0.1\nerror                   = goatbrot.err.0.1\nrequest_memory = 1GB\nrequest_disk       = 1GB\nrequest_cpus      = 1\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\ngoatbrot3.sub\n\n\nexecutable              = /usr/local/bin/goatbrot\narguments               = -i 100000 -c -0.75,-0.75 -w 1.5 -s 500,500 -o tile_1_0.ppm\nlog                     = goatbrot.log\noutput                  = goatbrot.out.1.0\nerror                   = goatbrot.err.1.0\nrequest_memory = 1GB\nrequest_disk       = 1GB\nrequest_cpus      = 1\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\ngoatbrot4.sub\n\n\nexecutable              = /usr/local/bin/goatbrot\narguments               = -i 100000 -c 0.75,-0.75 -w 1.5 -s 500,500 -o tile_1_1.ppm\nlog                     = goatbrot.log\noutput                  = goatbrot.out.1.1\nerror                   = goatbrot.err.1.1\nrequest_memory = 1GB\nrequest_disk       = 1GB\nrequest_cpus      = 1\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\nmontage.sub\n\n\nYou should notice that the \ntransfer_input_files\n statement refers to the files created by the other jobs.\n\n\nexecutable              = /usr/bin/montage\narguments               = tile_0_0.ppm tile_0_1.ppm tile_1_0.ppm tile_1_1.ppm -mode Concatenate -tile 2x2 mandel-from-dag.jpg\ntransfer_input_files    = tile_0_0.ppm,tile_0_1.ppm,tile_1_0.ppm,tile_1_1.ppm\noutput                  = montage.out\nerror                   = montage.err\nlog                     = montage.log\nrequest_memory = 1GB\nrequest_disk       = 1GB\nrequest_cpus      = 1\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\nMake your DAG\n\n\nIn a file called \ngoatbrot.dag\n, you have your DAG specification:\n\n\nJOB\n \ng1\n \ngoatbrot1\n.\nsub\n\n\nJOB\n \ng2\n \ngoatbrot2\n.\nsub\n\n\nJOB\n \ng3\n \ngoatbrot3\n.\nsub\n\n\nJOB\n \ng4\n \ngoatbrot4\n.\nsub\n\n\nJOB\n \nmontage\n \nmontage\n.\nsub\n\n\nPARENT\n \ng1\n \ng2\n \ng3\n \ng4\n \nCHILD\n \nmontage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk yourself: do you know how we ensure that all the \ngoatbrot\n commands can run simultaneously and all of them will complete before we run the montage job?\n\n\nRunning the DAG\n\n\nSubmit your DAG:\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncondor_submit_dag goatbrot.dag\n/strong\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFile for submitting this DAG to Condor           : goatbrot.dag.condor.sub\n\n\nLog of DAGMan debugging messages                 : goatbrot.dag.dagman.out\n\n\nLog of Condor library output                     : goatbrot.dag.lib.out\n\n\nLog of Condor library error messages             : goatbrot.dag.lib.err\n\n\nLog of the life of condor_dagman itself          : goatbrot.dag.dagman.log\n\n\n\nSubmitting job(s).\n\n\n1 job(s) submitted to cluster 71.\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch Your DAG\n\n\nLet\u2019s follow the progress of the whole DAG:\n\n\n\n\nUse the \nwatch\n command to run \ncondor_q -nobatch\n every 10 seconds: \n\n\n\n\n \nwatch -n 10 condor_q -nobatch\n\n\n%RED%Here we see DAGMan running:\n -- Submitter: learn.chtc.wisc.edu : \n128.104.100.55:9618?sock=28867_10e4_2\n : learn.chtc.wisc.edu ID OWNER SUBMITTED RUN_TIME ST PRI SIZE CMD 71.0 roy 6/22 17:39 0+00:00:03 R 0 0.3 condor_dagman\n\n\n1 jobs;

DAGMan ran as much of the DAG as possible and logged enough information to continue the run when the situation is resolved. Do you see the part where it wrote the resuce DAG?  Look at the rescue DAG. It's called a partial DAG: it indicates what part of the DAG has already been completed. When you re-submit the original DAG, DAGMan will notice the rescue DAG and use it in combination with the original DAG. (The rescue DAG used to be the full DAG with nodes marked as done and you would ask DAGMan to run the new rescue DAG. For your simplicity DAGMan lets you resubmit the original DAG and it reads both files.)  %  cat goatbrot.dag.rescue001 #  Rescue DAG file, created after running #    the goatbrot.dag DAG file #  Created  6 /22/2012  23 :08:42 UTC % RED%# Rescue DAG version:  2 .0.1  ( partial ) %ENDCOLOR% #  #  Total number of Nodes:  5  #  Nodes premarked DONE:  4  % RED%# Nodes that failed:  1  #    montage, ENDLIST %ENDCOLOR% DONE g1  DONE g2  DONE g3  DONE g4   From the comment near the top, we know that the montage node failed.

Additionally, you will learn about the \ntar\n and \nscp\n commands, which will allow you to efficiently copy files between the two submit nodes.\n\n\nIf you have trouble getting \nssh\n access to the submit machine, ask the instructors right away! Gaining access is critical for all remaining exercises.\n\n\nLog in to the OSG submit machine\n\n\nFor some of the remaining exercises today, you will be using a machine named \nosg-learn.chtc.wisc.edu\n. The username and password are listed on your 'Accounts' paper that you received yesterday. If you no longer have it, please ask the instructors for help.\n\n\nOnce you have your account details, \nssh\n in to the machine and take a look around.\n\n\nPreparing files for transfer\n\n\nWhen transferring files between computers, it's best to limit the number of files as well as their size. Smaller files transfer more quickly and if your network connection drops, restarting the transfer is less painful than it would be if you were transferring large files.\n\n\nArchiving tools (WinZip, 7zip, Archive Utility, etc.) can compress the size of your files and place them into a single, smaller archive file. The \ntar\n command is a one-stop shop for creating, extracting, and viewing the contents of \ntar\n archives (called tarballs) whose usage is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nTo \ncreate\n a tarball named \narchive filename\n containing \narchive contents\n, use the following command: \\\n\n\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ntar -czvf \narchive filename\n \narchive contents\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\ \n Where \narchive filename\n should end in \n.tar.gz\n and \narchive contents\n can be a list of any number of files and/or folders, separated by spaces.\n\n\n\n\nTo \nextract\n the files from a tarball into the current directory: \\\n\n\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ntar -xzvf \narchive filename\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo \nlist\n the files within a tarball: \\\n\n\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ntar -tzvf \narchive filename\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the above knowledge, log into \nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n, create a tarball that contains Monday's exercise 2.4 directory, and verify that it contains all the proper files.\n\n\nComparing compressed sizes\n\n\nYou can adjust the level of compression of \ntar\n by prepending your command with \nGZIP=--\nspan style=\"background-color: #FFCCFF;\"\nCOMPRESSION\n/span\n, where \nspan style=\"background-color: #FFCCFF;\"\nCOMPRESSION\n/span\n can be either \nfast\n for the least compression, or \nbest\n for the most compression (the default compression is between \nbest\n and \nfast\n).\n\n\n\n\nUse \nwget\n to download the following files from our web server:\n\n\nText file: \nhttp://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/osgschool17/random_text\n\n\nArchive: \nhttp://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/osgschool17/pdbaa.tar.gz\n\n\nImage: \nhttp://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/osgschool17/obligatory_cat.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse \ntar\n on each file and compare the sizes of the original file and the compressed version.\n\n\n\n\nWhich files were compressed the least? Why?\n\n\nTransferring files\n\n\nUsing secure copy\n\n\nSecure copy\n (\nscp\n) is a command based on \nSSH\n that lets you securely copy files between two different hosts.

The invocation is similar to \nscp\n: you can transfer files and/or folders, but the options are different and when transferring folders, make sure they don't have a trailing slash (\n/\n, this means to copy all the files within the folder instead of the folder itself):\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nrsync -Pavz \nsource\n \n1\n \nsource\n \n2\n...\nsource\n N\n \nremote host\n:\nremote path\n \n\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrsync\n has many benefits over \nscp\n but two of its biggest features are built-in compression (so you don't have to create a tarball) and the ability to only transfer files that have changed. Both of these feature are helpful when you're having connectivity issues so that you don't have to restart the transfer from scratch every time your connection fails.\n\n\n\n\nUse \nrsync\n to transfer the folder containing today's exercise 1.1 to \nosg-learn.chtc.wisc.edu\n\n\nCreate a new file in your exercise 1.1 folder on \nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n with the \ntouch\n command: \\ \n \ntouch \n\n\nUse the same \nrsync\n command to transfer the folder with the new file you just created.

Specifically, we will look at how easy it is to get access to resources in terms of the amount of memory that is requested. This will not be a very careful study, but should give you some idea of one way in which the pools are different.\n\n\nIn the first two parts of the exercise, you will submit a bunch of jobs that differ only in how much memory each one requests; we call this a \nparameter sweep\n, in that we are testing many possible values of a parameter. We will request memory from 1\u201316 GB, doubling the memory each time. One set of jobs will be submitted locally, and the other, identical set of jobs will be submitted to OSG. You will check the queue periodically to see how many jobs have completed and how many are still waiting to run.\n\n\nPart 1: Checking on the availability of memory (locally)\n\n\nIn this first part, you will create the submit file for both the local and OSG jobs, then submit the local set.\n\n\nYet another queue syntax\n\n\nYesterday, you learned about the \nqueue\n statement and some of the different ways it can be invoked to submit multiple jobs. Similar to the \nqueue from\n statement to submit jobs based on lines from a specific file, you can use \nqueue in\n to submit jobs based on a list directly from your submit file:\n\n\nqueue \n# of jobs\n \nvariable\n in (\n\nitem 1\n\n\nitem 2\n\n\nitem 3\n\n...\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, to submit 6 jobs that sleep for \n5\n, \n5\n, \n10\n, \n10\n, \n15\n, and \n15\n seconds, you could write a submit file like the following:\n\n\nexecutable = /bin/sleep\n\nqueue 2 arguments in (\n5\n10\n15\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nTry submitting this file yourself and checking the jobs that end up in the queue with \ncondor_q -nobatch\n.\n\n\nCreate the submit files\n\n\nTo create our parameter sweep, we will create one submit file with multiple queue statements and change the value of our parameter (\nrequest_memory\n) for each batch of jobs.\n\n\n\n\nIf not already, log on to \nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n\n\nCreate and change into a new subdirectory called \ntuesday-2.1\n \u2013 doing things this way will make Part 2 much easier\n\n\nCreate a submit file that is named \nsleep.sub\n and that executes the command =/bin/sleep 30=\\ \nIf you do not remember all of the submit statements to write this file, or just to go faster, find a similar submit file from yesterday, copy and rename it here, and make sure the argument to \nsleep\n is \n30\n (although the exact value does not matter for the test).\n\n\nUse the \nqueue in\n syntax to submit 25 jobs requesting 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32GB of memory, e.g. you should have 5 jobs requesting 2GB, 5 jobs requesting 4GB, etc.\n\n\nSave the submit file and exit your editor\n\n\nSubmit your jobs\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring the local jobs\n\n\nEvery few minutes, run \ncondor_q\n and see how your sleep jobs are doing. To easily see how many jobs of each type you have left, run the following command:\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% condor_q \nspan \nstyle\n=\nbackground-color: #D1CAF2;\nCluster ID\n/span\n -af RequestMemory \n|\n sort -n \n|\n uniq -c\n\n\n\n\n\nThe numbers in the left column are the number of jobs left of that type and the number on the right is the amount of memory you requested in MB. Consider making a little table like the one below to track progress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMemory\n\n\nRemaining #1\n\n\nRemaining #2\n\n\nRemaining #3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 GB\n\n\n5\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 GB\n\n\n5\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8 GB\n\n\n5\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16 GB\n\n\n5\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n32 GB\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, between checking on your local jobs, start Part 2 \u2013 taking a break every few minutes to record progress on your local jobs.\n\n\nPart 2: Checking on the availability of memory (remotely)\n\n\nFor the second part of the exercise, you will just copy over the directory from part 1 on \nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n to \nosg-learn.chtc.wisc.edu\n and resubmit your jobs to the OSG. You should have plenty of experience copying over files with \nscp\n and submitting them to the OSG so I won't provide instructions here. If you get stuck at any point in this process, refer to \nexercise 1.2\n.\n\n\nMonitoring the remote jobs\n\n\nAs you did in part 1, use \ncondor_q\n to track how your sleep jobs are doing. You can move onto the next exercise but keep tracking the status of your jobs. After you are done with the rest of the exercises, come back to this exercise, and move onto part 3\n\n\nPart 3: Analyzing the results\n\n\nNow that you've finished the other exercise, how many jobs have completed locally? How many have completed remotely?\n\n\nDue to the dynamic nature of the remote pool, the OSG may have noticed the demand for higher memory jobs and leased more high memory slots for our pool. That being said, 8GB+ slots are a high-demand, low-availability resource in the OSG so it's unlikely that all of your 8GB+ jobs matched and ran to completion. On the other hand, the local cluster has plenty of 8GB+ slots so all your jobs have a high chance of running.\n\n\nNext exercise\n\n\nOnce completed, move onto the next exercise: \nSoftware Differences in the OSG",

An easy way to show this attribute for all slots is by using \ncondor_status\n in conjunction with the \n-autoformat\n option. \n-autoformat\n like the \n-format\n option you learned about yesterday will print out the attributes you're interested in for each slot but as you probably guessed, perform the formatting in an automatic way. So to show the operating system and version of each slot, run the following command in both of your terminal windows:\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% condor_status -autoformat OpSysAndVer\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will see many values with the type of operating system at the front and the version number at the end (i.e. SL6 stands for Scientific Linux 6). The only problem is that with hundreds or thousands of slots, it's difficult to get a feel for the composition of each pool from this output. You can find a count for each operating system by passing the \ncondor_status\n output into the \nsort\n and \nuniq\n commands.

This exercise should take 5-10 minutes.\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nThere is a large amount of scientific software that is available as source code. Source code is usually a group of text files (code) meant to be downloaded and then compiled into a \nbinary file\n which a computer can understand. Sometimes the source code depends on other pieces of code called libraries. If the source code is linked \nstatically\n, these libraries are bundled into the compilation with the source code, creating a \nstatic binary\n which can be run on any computer with the same operating system.\n\n\nOur Software Example\n\n\nFor this compiling example, we will use a script written in C. C code depends on libraries and therefore will benefit from being statically linked.\n\n\nOur C code prints 7 rows of Pascal's triangle.\n\n\n\n\nLog into the OSG submit node \nosg-learn.chtc.wisc.edu\n. Create a directory for this exercise and \ncd\n into it.\n\n\nCopy and paste the following code into a file named \npascal.c\n. \\\n\n\n\n\n\\\n\n\n#include \nltstdio.h\ngt\n\nlong factorial(int);\n\nint main()\n{\n   int i, n, c;\n   n=7;\n   for (i = 0; i \n n; i++){\n      for (c = 0; c \n= (n - i - 2); c++)\n         printf(\n \n);\n      for (c = 0 ; c \n= i; c++)\n         printf(\n%ld \n,factorial(i)/(factorial(c)*factorial(i-c)));\n      printf(\n\\n\n);\n   }\n   return 0;\n}\n\nlong factorial(int n)\n{\n   int c;\n   long result = 1;\n   for (c = 1; c \n= n; c++)\n         result = result*c;\n   return result;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nCompiling\n\n\nIn order to use this code in a job, we will first need to statically compile the code. Recall the slide from the lecture - where \ncan\n we compile and where \nshould\n we compile? In particular:\n\n\n\n\nWhere is the compiler available?\n\n\n\n\nHow computationally intensive will this compilation be?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about these questions before moving on. Where do you think we should compile?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\ 2. Most linux servers (including our submit node) have the \ngcc\n (GNU compiler collection) installed, so we already have a compiler on the submit node. Furthermore, this is a simple piece of C code, so the compilation will not be computationally intensive. Thus, we should be able to compile directly on the submit node. \\\n\n\n\n\nCompile the code, using the command: \\ \n \n \ngcc -static pascal.c -o pascal\n \n\\ \\ Note that we have added the \n-static\n option to make sure that the compiled binary includes the necessary libraries. This will allow the code to run on any Linux machine, no matter where those libraries are located. \\ 4. Verify that the compiled binary was statically linked:\\ \n \nfile pascal\n\\ \nThe Linux \nfile\n command provides information about the \ntype\n or \nkind\n of file that is given as an argument. In this case, you should get output like this:\n\\ \npascal: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), \nstatically linked\n, for GNU/Linux 2.6.18, not stripped\n\\ \nNote the highlighted part, which clearly states that this executable (software) is statically linked. The same command run on a non-statically linked executable file would include the text \ndynamically linked (uses shared libs)\n instead. So with this simple verification step, which could even be run on files that you did not compile yourself, you have some further reassurance that it is safe to use on other Linux machines. (Bonus exercise: Try the \nfile\n command on lots of other files)\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the Job\n\n\nNow that our code is compiled, we can use it to submit a job.\n\n\n\n\nThink about what submit file lines we need to use to run this job:\n\n\nAre there input files?\n\n\nAre there command line arguments?\n\n\nWhere is its output written?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\\n\n\n\n\nBased on what you thought about in 1., find a submit file from earlier in the week that you can modify to run our compiled \npascal\n code. \\\n\n\n\n\nCopy it to the directory with the \npascal\n binary and make those changes. \\ 2. Submit the job using \ncondor_submit\n. \\ 3.

This exercise should take 10-15 minutes.\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nIn the previous exercise, we used a piece of software that was available as source code, and could be compiled to a static binary. However, software is available in many different forms. You may also encounter scientific software provided as a static binary. Here, the software provider has compiled the software for you (typically on several operating systems). Using a pre-compiled binary means you can avoid compiling the code yourself; accessing the software and getting it ready to run is as simple as downloading the binary.\n\n\nOur Software Example\n\n\nThe software we will be using for this example is a common tool for aligning genome and protein sequences against a\nreference database, the BLAST program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch the internet for the BLAST software.  Searches might include \"blast executable\n\n\nor \"download blast software\".  Hopefully these searches will lead you to a BLAST website page that looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the title that says \"Download BLAST\" and then look for the link that has the latest installation and source\n    code.  You should end up on a page with a list of each version of BLAST that is available for different operating\n    systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could download the source and compile it ourselves, but instead, we're going to use \\\n\n\n\n\n\n\none of the pre-built binaries. \\ Before proceeding, look at the list of downloads and try to determine which one you want. \\\n\n\n\n\nBased on our operating system, we want to use the Linux binary, which is \\\n\n\n\n\nlabelled with the \nx64-linux\n suffix. All the other links are either for source code or other operating systems. \\ While logged into \nosg-learn.chtc.wisc.edu\n, create a directory for this exercise. Then download the appropriate \ntar.gz\n file and un-tar it. \\ You can download the file directly from the BLAST website using \nwget\n or download our local copy with the command below: \\\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nwget http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/osgschool17/ncbi-blast-2.6.0+-x64-linux.tar.gz\n/strong\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ntar -xzf ncbi-blast-2.6.0+-x64-linux.tar.gz\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe're going to be using the \nblastx\n binary in our job. Where is \\\n\n\n\n\nit in the directory you just downloaded?\n\n\nCopy the Input Files\n\n\nTo run BLAST, we need an input file and reference database. For this example, we'll use the \"pdbaa\" database, which contains sequences for the protein structure from the Protein Data Bank. For our input file, we'll use an abbreviated fasta file with mouse genome information.\n\n\n\n\nDownload these files to your current directory: \\\n\n\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nwget http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/osgschool17/pdbaa.tar.gz\n/strong\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nwget http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/osgschool17/mouse.fa\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntar the \npdbaa\n database: \\\n\n\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ntar -xzf pdbaa.tar.gz\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitting the Job\n\n\nWe now have our program (the pre-compiled \nblastx\n binary) and our input files, so all that remains is to create the submit file. A typical \nblastx\n command looks something like this:\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\n blastx -db database -query input_file -out results.txt\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy the submit file from the last exercise into your current directory. 2. Think about which lines you will need to change or add to your submit file in order to submit \\\n\n\n\n\nthe job successfully. In particular:\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the executable?\n\n\nHow can you indicate the entire command line sequence above?\n\n\nWhich files need to be transferred in addition to the executable?\n\n\nDoes this job require a certain type of operating system?\n\n\n\n\n\\ 3. Try to answer these questions and modify your submit file appropriately. 4.

It should take 30-35 minutes.\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nSome software cannot be compiled into a single executable, whether you compile it yourself (as in \nExercise 1.1\n) or download it already compiled (as in \nExercise 1.2\n). In this case, it is necessary to download or create a portable copy of the software and then use a wrapper script (as in the \nprevious exercise\n) to \"install\" the software on a per job basis. This script can either install the software from the source code, or (as in this exercise), unpack a portable software package that you've pre-built yourself.\n\n\nOur Software Example\n\n\nFor this exercise, we will be using the Bayseian inference package Open BUGS. Open BUGS is a good example of software that is not compiled to a single executable; it has multiple executables as well as a helper library.\n\n\n\n\nDo an internet search to find the Open BUGS software downloads page.\n\n\nCreate a directory for this exercise on the CHTC submit server \nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n (\nnot\n \nosg-learn.chtc.wisc.edu\n), download the source code (\nOpenBUGS-3.2.3.tar.gz\n), and place it in this directory.\n\n\n\n\nNote: The OpenBUGS source tarball cannot be downloaded via \nwget=; you will need to download the source to your own computer and then transfer it to =learn.chtc.wisc.edu\n.\n\n\nWhere to Prepare\n\n\nOur goal is to pre-build an Open BUGS installation, and then write a script that will unpack that installation and run a simulation.\n\n\n\n\nWhere can we create this pre-built installation? Based on the end of the lecture, what are our options and which would be most appropriate? Make a guess before moving on.\n\n\nBecause we're on the CHTC-based submit node (\nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n), we have the option of using an interactive job to build the Open BUGS installation. This is a good option because the submit server is already busy with lots of users and we don't know how long the Open BUGS install will take. To submit an interactive job do the following:\n\n\nCopy the following lines into a file named \nbuild.submit\n \\\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuniverse = vanilla\n\noutput = build.out\nerror = build.err\nlog = build.log\n\nshould_transfer_files = YES\nwhen_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT\ntransfer_input_files = \n\nrequest_disk = 2GB\nrequest_memory = 2GB\n\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote the lack of executable. Condor doesn't need an executable for this job because it will be interactive, meaning \nyou\n are running the commands instead of Condor.\n\n\nIn order to create the installation, we will need the source code to come with us. The \ntransfer_input_files\n line is blank - \nfill it in with the name of our Open BUGS source tarball\n.\n\n\nTo request an interactive job, we will add a \n-i\n flag to the \ncondor_submit\n command. The whole command you enter should look like this: \\\n\n\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncondor_submit -i build.submit\n/strong\n \n\n\n\n\n\nRead Through Installation Documentation\n\n\nWhile you're waiting for the interactive job to start, you can start reading the Open BUGS installation documentation online.\n\n\n\n\nFind the installation instructions for Open BUGS.\n\n\nOn the downloads page, there are short instructions for how to install Open BUGS. There are two options shown for installation -- which should we use?\n\n\nThe first installation option given uses \nsudo\n -- which is an administrative permission that you won't have as a normal user. Luckily, as described in the \\\n\n\n\n\ninstructions, you can use the \n--prefix\n option to set where Open BUGS will be installed, which will allow us to install it without administrative permissions.\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nYour interactive job should have started by now and we've learned about installing our program. Let's test it out.\n\n\n\n\nBefore we follow the installation instructions, we should create a directory to hold our installation. You can create this in the current directory. \\\n\n\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nmkdir openbugs\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\\n\n\n\n\nNow run the commands to unpack the source code: \\\n\n\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ntar zxvf OpenBUGS-3.2.3.tar.gz\n/strong\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncd OpenBUGS-3.2.3\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\\n\n\n\n\nNow we can follow the second set of installation instructions. For the prefix, we'll use the command \n$(pwd)\n to capture the name of our \\\n\n\n\n\ncurrent working directory and then a relative path to the \nopenbugs\n directory we created in step 1: \\\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\n./configure --prefix\n=\n$(\npwd\n)\n/../openbugs\n/strong\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nmake\n/strong\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nmake install\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\\n\n\n\n\nGo back to the job's main working directory\n: \\\n\n\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncd ..\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\ and confirm that our installation procedure created \nbin\n, \\ \nlib\n, and \nshare\n directories. \\\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nls openbugs\n/strong\n\n\nbin lib share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\\n\n\n\n\nNow we want to package up our installation, so we can use it in other jobs. We can do this simply by compressing any necessary directories \\\n\n\n\n\ninto a single gzipped tarball. \\\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ntar -czf openbugs.tar.gz openbugs/\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\\n\n\n\n\nOnce everything is complete, type \nexit\n to leave the interactive job. Make sure that your tarball is in the main working directory - it will be transferred back to the submit server automatically. \\\n\n\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nexit\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that we now have two tarballs in our directory -- the \nsource\n tarball (\nOpenBUGS-3.2.3.tar.gz\n), which we will no longer need and our newly built installation (\nopenbugs.tar.gz\n) which is what we will actually be using to run jobs.\n\n\nWrapper Script\n\n\nNow that we've created our portable installation, we need to write a script that opens and uses the installation, similar to the process we used in the \\ \nprevious exercise\n. These steps should be performed back on the submit server (\nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n).\n\n\n\n\nCreate a script called \nrun_openbugs.sh\n. The script will first need to untar our installation, so the script should start out like this: \\ \n\n\n\n\n#/bin/bash\n\n\ntar -xzf openbugs.tar.gz \n\\\n\n\n\n\nWe're going to use the same \n$(pwd)\n trick from the installation in order to tell the computer how to find Open BUGS. We will \\\n\n\n\n\ndo this by setting the \nPATH\n environment variable, to include the directory where Open BUGS is installed: \\\n\n\nexport PATH=$(pwd)/openbugs/bin:$PATH\n\n\n\n\n\n\\\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the wrapper script needs to not only setup Open BUGS, but actually run the program. Add the following lines to your \nrun_openbugs.sh\n wrapper script. \\\n\n\n\n\nOpenBUGS \n input.txt \n results.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\\\n\n\n\n\nMake sure the wrapper script has executable permissions: \\\n\n\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nchmod u+x run_openbugs.sh\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun a Open BUGS job\n\n\nWe're almost ready! We need two more pieces to run a OpenBUGS job.\n\n\n\n\nDownload the necessary input files to your directory on the submit server and then untar them. \\\n\n\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nwget http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/osgschool17/openbugs_files.tar.gz\n/strong\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ntar -xzf openbugs_files.tar.gz\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur last step is to create a submit file for our Open BUGS job. Think about which lines this submit file will need. Make a copy of a previous submit file (you could use the blast submit file from the \nprevious exercise\n as a base) and modify it as you think necessary.\n\n\nThe two most important lines to modify for this job are listed below; check them against your own submit file: \\\n\n\n\n\nexecutable = run_openbugs.sh\ntransfer_input_files = openbugs.tar.gz, openbugs_files/\n\n\n\n\n\n\\ A wrapper script will always be a job's \nexecutable\n. When using a wrapper script, you must also always remember to transfer the software/source code using \ntransfer_input_files\n. \\ \nNote:\n the \n/\n in the \ntransfer_input_files\n line indicates that we are transferring the \ncontents\n of that directory (which in this case, is what we want), rather than the directory itself.\n\n\n\n\nWe also need to add a requirement to ensure that the job will run on a Linux system, running major version 6. This can be done with the line: \\\n\n\n\n\nrequirements = (OpSys == \nLINUX\n) \n (OpSysMajorVer == 6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the job with \ncondor_submit\n.\n\n\nOnce the job completes, it should produce a \nresults.txt\n file.",

However, imagine if you wanted to run the same job multiple times, or even just try out one or two different options or inputs. Instead of writing new wrapper scripts for each job, you can modify the script so that some of the values are set by \narguments\n.

This exercise will draw on the idea of writing a wrapper script to install and run code, first introduced in \nExercise 1.3\n and should take 25-30 minutes.\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nMatlab is licensed; however, unlike most licensed software, it has the ability to be compiled and the compiled code can be run without a license. We will be compiling Matlab \n.m\n files into a binary file and running that binary using a set of files called the Matlab runtime.\n\n\nMatlab Code\n\n\n\n\nLog in to the CHTC submit server (\nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n).\n\n\nCreate a directory for this exercise and \ncd\n into it . 2. Copy the following code into a file called \nmatrix.m\n \\\n\n\n\n\n\\\n\n\nA = randi(100,4,4)\nb = randi(100,4,1);\nx = A\\b\nsave results.txt x -ascii\n\n\n\n\n\n\\\n\n\nCompiling Matlab Code\n\n\nThe first step in making Matlab portable is compiling our Matlab script. To compile this code, we need to access the machines with the Matlab compiler installed. For this exercise, we will use the compilers installed on special CHTC build machines. In the CHTC pool, you can't use \nssh\n to directly connect to these machines. Instead, you must submit an interactive job (like in \nExercise 1.4\n) that specifically requests these build machines.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a file called \ncompile.submit\n with the lines below: \\\n\n\n\n\n\\\n\n\nuniverse = vanilla\n\noutput = compile.out\nerror = compile.err\nlog = compile.log\n\nshould_transfer_files = YES\nwhen_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT\ntransfer_input_files = matrix.m\n\n+IsBuildJob = true\nrequirements = (OpSysMajorVer == 6) \n ( IsBuildSlot == true )\nrequest_memory = 1GB\nrequest_disk = 100MB \n\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\n\\\n\n\n\n\nYou can initiate the interactive job by using \ncondor_submit\n 's \n-i\n option. Enter the following command: \\\n\n\n\n\n\\\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncondor_submit -i compile.submit\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\ Make sure you've submitted this command from \nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n! Once the job starts, continue with the following instructions.\n\n\n\n\nSince you are a guest user on our system, you will need to set your \nHOME\n directory by running this command: \\\n\n\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nexport \nHOME\n=\n$PWD\n/strong\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\\\n\n\n\n\nCompile your Matlab code with version 2015b. \\\n\n\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\n/usr/local/MATLAB/R2015b/bin/mcc -m -R -singleCompThread -R -nodisplay -R -nojvm matrix.m\n/strong\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\\ The extra arguments to the \nmcc\n command are very important here. Matlab, by default, will run on as many CPUs as it can find. This can be a big problem \\ when running on someone else's computers, because your Matlab code might interfere with what the owner wants. The \n-singleCompThread\n option \\ compiles the code to run on a single CPU, avoiding this problem. In addition, the \n-nodisplay\n and \n-nojvm\n options turn off the display (which won't exist \\ where the code runs). \\\n\n\n\n\nTo exit the interactive session, type \nexit\n\n\nNow that you're back on the submit server, look at the files that were created by the Matlab compiler. Which one is the compiled binary?\n\n\n\n\nMatlab Runtime\n\n\nThe newly compiled binary will require the 2015b Matlab runtime to run. You can download the runtime from the Mathworks website and build it yourself, but to save time, for this exercise you can download the pre-built runtimes hosted by CHTC.\n\n\n\n\nDownload the 2015b Matlab runtime hosted by CHTC: \\\n\n\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nwget http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/r2015b.tar.gz \n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\\n\n\nWrapper Script\n\n\nLike the \nOpenBUGS\n example from earlier this morning, we will need a wrapper script to open the Matlab runtime and then run our compiled Matlab code. Our wrapper script will need to accomplish the following steps:\n\n\n\n\nUnpack the transferred runtime\n\n\nSet the environment variables\n\n\nRun our compiled matlab code\n\n\n\n\nFortunately, the Matlab compiler has pre-written most of this wrapper script for us!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a look at \nrun_matrix.sh\n. Which of the above steps do we need to add? Once you have an idea, move to the next step.\\\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe'll need to add commands to unpack the runtime (which will have been transferred with the job).

Once you have an idea, move to the next step.\\\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe name of the Matlab runtime directory is a required argument to the wrapper script \nrun_matrix.sh\n. We'll have to do a little extra work to find out the name of that directory. 2. Untar the runtime tarball we downloaded to the submit server. 3. What directory has been created? This is the name of the runtime directory, and the argument you should pass to \nrun_matrix.sh\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitting the Job\n\n\n\n\nCopy an existing submit file into your current directory. The submit file we used for the \nOpen Bugs\n example would be a good candidate, as that example also used a wrapper script. 2. Modify your submit file for this job. 3. Check your changes against the list below.\n\n\nThe \nexecutable\n for this job is going to be our wrapper script \nrun_matrix.sh\n. \\\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexecutable = run_matrix.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need to transfer the compiled binary \nmatrix\n, as well as the runtime \n.tar.gz\n file, using \ntransfer_input_files\n. \\\n\n\n\n\ntransfer_input_files = matrix, r2015b.tar.gz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe argument for the executable (\nrun_matrix.sh\n) is \"v90\", as that is the name of the un-tarred runtime directory. \\\n\n\n\n\narguments = v90\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the size of the untarred runtime directory by running: \\\n\n\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ndu -sh v90/\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\ We need to request \nat least\n this much \\ disk space in our submit file: \\\n\n\nrequest_disk = 2GB\n\n\n\n\n\n\\\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the job using \ncondor_submit\n. 4.

It should take about 20 minutes.\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nWe chose Python as the language for this example because: a) it is a common language used for scientific computing and b) it has a straightforward installation process and is fairly portable.\n\n\nRunning any Python script requires an installation of the Python interpreter. The Python interpreter is what we're using when we type \npython\n at the command line. In order to run Python jobs on a distributed system, you will need to install the Python interpreter (what we often refer to as just \"installing Python\"), within the job, then run your Python script.\n\n\nThere are two installation approaches. The approach we will cover in this exercise is that of \"pre-building\" the installation (much like we did with Open BUGS \nthir morning\n). We will install Python to a specific directory, and then create a tarball of that installation directory. We can then use our tarball within jobs to run Python scripts.\n\n\nInteractive Job for Pre-Building\n\n\nThe first step in our job process is building a Python installation that we can package up.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a directory for this exercise on \nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n and \ncd\n into it.\n\n\nDownload the Python source code from \nhttps://www.python.org/\n. \\\n\n\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nwget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.1/Python-3.6.1.tgz\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf our options - submit server, interactive job, personal computer - which should we use for this installation/packaging process? Once you have a guess, move to the next step.\n\n\nDue to the number of people on our submit server, we shouldn't use the submit server. Your own computer probably doesn't have the right operating system. \\\n\n\n\n\nThe best place to install will be an interactive job. For this job, we can use the same interactive submit file as Exercise 1.4, with one change. What is it?\n\n\n\n\nMake a copy of the interactive submit file from \nExercise 1.4\n and change the \ntransfer_input_files\n line to the Python tarball you just downloaded. Then submit it using the \n-i\n flag. \\\n\n\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncondor_submit -i build.submit\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the interactive job begins, we can start our installation process. First, we have to determine how to install Python to a specific location in our working directory.\n\n\nUntar the Python source tarball and look at the \nREADME\n in the \nPython-3.6.1\n directory. What will the main installation steps be? Where will Python be installed by default? Once you've tried to answer these questions, move to the next step.\n\n\nThere are some basic installation \\\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninstructions near the top of the \nREADME\n. Based on that short introduction, we can see the main steps of installation will be: \\\n\n\n./configure\nmake\nmake install\n\n\n\n\n\n\\ \\ This looks a lot like the Open BUGS installation from earlier today! It turns out that this three-stage process (configure, make, make install) is a common \\ way to install many software packages. \\ \\ Also like the Open BUGS installation, the default installation \\ location for Python requires \nsudo\n (administrative privileges) to install. However, we'd like to install to a specific location in the working directory \\ so that we can compress that installation directory into a tarball. How did we do this with Open BUGS? \\\n\n\n\n\nWith Open BUGS we used the \n-prefix\n option with the \nconfigure\n script. Let's see if the Python \\\n\n\n\n\nconfigure\n script has this option by using the \"help\" option. \\ \\\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\n./configure --help\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\ \\ Sure enough, there's a list of all the different options that can be passed to the \nconfigure\n script, which includes \n-prefix\n. Therefore, we can use the \\ \n$(pwd)\n command in order to set the path correctly, just as we did earlier today.\n\n\n\n\nNow let's actually install Python!\n\n\nFrom the job's main working directory\n, create a directory to hold the installation. \\\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncd \n$_CONDOR_SCRATCH_DIR\n/strong\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nmkdir python\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMove into the \nPython 3.6.1\n directory and run the installation commands. These may take a few minutes each. \\\n\n\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncd Python-3.6.1\n/strong\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\n./configure --prefix\n=\n$(\npwd\n)\n/../python\n/strong\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nmake\n/strong\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nmake install\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I move back to the main job working directory, and look in the \npython\n subdirectory, I should see a Python installation. \\\n\n\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncd ..\n/strong\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nls python/\n/strong\n\n\nbin  include  lib  share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have successfully created a self-contained Python installation.

Try running it on the submit server.\n\n\n\n\nWrapper Script\n\n\nWe now have our Python installation and our Python script - we just need to write a wrapper script to run them.\n\n\n\n\nWhat steps do you think the wrapper script needs to perform? Create a file called \nrun_fib.sh\n and write them out in plain English before moving to the next step.\n\n\nOur script will need to\n\n\nuntar our \nprebuilt_python.tar.gz\n file\n\n\naccess the \npython\n command from our installation to run our \nfib.py\n script\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry turning your plain English steps into commands that the computer can run.\n\n\nYour final \nrun_fib.sh\n script should look something like this: \\ \n\n\n\n\n#/bin/bash\n\n\ntar xzf prebuilt_python.tar.gz python/bin/python3 fib.py 5 \n\\ or\\ \n #/bin/bash\n\n\ntar xzf prebuilt_python.tar.gz export PATH=$(pwd)/python/bin:$PATH python3 fib.py 5 \n\\\n\n\n\n\nMake sure your \nrun_fib.sh\n script is executable.\n\n\n\n\nSubmit File\n\n\n\n\nMake a copy of a previous submit file in your local directory (the Open BUGS submit file could be a good starting point).

In this exercise we'll use the same \nblastx\n example job that we used previously, but\nmodify the submit file and test how much memory and disk space it uses on the execute node.\n\n\nStart with a test submit file\n\n\nWe've started a submit file for you, below, which you'll add to in the remaining steps.\n\n\nexecutable = \ntransfer_input_files = \noutput = test.out\nerror = test.error\nlog = test.log\nrequest_memory = \nrequest_disk = \nrequest_cpus = 1\nrequirements = (OpSys == \nLINUX\n)\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\nImplement file compression\n\n\nIn our first blast job from yesterday, the database files in the \npdbaa\n directory were all transferred, as is, but we could instead transfer them as a single, compressed file using \ntar\n. For a second test job, let's compress our blast database files to send them to the submit node as a single \ntar.gz\n file, by following the below steps\n\n\n\n\nChange into the \npdbaa\n directory and compress the database files into a single file called \npdbaa_files.tar.gz\n using the \ntar\n command. (NOTE: This file will be different from the \npdbaa.tar.gz\n files you downloaded yesterday, because it will only contain the \npdbaa\n files, and not the \npdbaa\n directory, itself.)\n\n\n\n\nA typical command for creating a tar file is:\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ntar -cvzf \n[\ncompressed filename\n]\n \n[\nlist of files\n]\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMove this file to the \nthur-blast-data\n directory.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a wrapper script that will first decompress the \npdbaa_files.tar.gz\n file, and then run blast.\n\n\n\n\nBecause this file will now be our submit file \nexecutable\n, we'll also end up transferring the \nblastx\n executable with \ntransfer_input_files\n. In the \nthur-blast-data\n directory, create a new file, called \nblast_wrapper.sh\n, with the following contents:\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\ntar xvzf pdbaa_files.tar.gz\n\n./blastx -db pdbaa -query mouse.fa -out mouse.fa.result\n\nrm pdbaa.*\n\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT: The last line removes the resulting database files that came from \npdbaa_files.tar.gz\n, as these files would otherwise be copied back to the submit server as perceived output (because they're new files that HTCondor didn't transfer over as input).\n\n\nList the executable and input files\n\n\nMake sure to update the submit file with the following:\n\n\n\n\nAdd the new \nexecutable\n (the wrapper script you created above)\n\n\nList the \nblastx\n binary, the \npdbaa_files.tar.gz\n file, and the input query file in \ntransfer_input_files\n\n\n\n\nHINT: Remember that \ntransfer_input_files\n accepts a comma separated list of files, and that you need to list the full location of the \nblastx\n executable (\nblastx\n). There will be no arguments, since the arguments to the \nblastx\n command are now captured in the wrapper script.\n\n\nPredict memory and disk requests from your data\n\n\nAlso, think about how much memory and disk to request for this job. It's good to start with values that are a little higher than you think a test job will need, but think about:\n\n\n\n\nhow much memory \nblastx\n would use if it loaded all of the database files \nand\n the query input file into memory.\n\n\nhow much disk space will be necessary on the execute server for the executable, all input files, and all output files (hint: the log file only exists on the submit node).\n\n\nwhether you'd like to request some extra memory or disk space, just in case\n\n\n\n\nLook at the \nlog\n file for your \nblastx\n job from yesterday, and compare the memory and disk \"Usage\" to what you predicted from the files. Make sure to update the submit file with more accurate memory and disk requests (you may still want to request slightly more than the job actually used).\n\n\nRun the test job\n\n\nOnce you have finished editing the submit file, go ahead and submit the job. It should take a few minutes to complete, and then you can check to make sure that no unwanted files (especially the \npdbaa\n database files) were copied back at the end of the job.\n\n\nRun a \ndu -sh\n on the directory with this job's input.

Splitting the input will also mean that we don't have to rely on additional large-data measures for the input query files.\n\n\nSetup\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you are still logged into \nuser-training.osgconnect.net\n\n\nMake sure you are in the directory named \nthur-blast-data\n under the \nstash\n filesystem.\n\n\n\n\nObtain the large input\n\n\nWe've previously used \nblastx\n to analyze a relatively small input file of test data, \nmouse.fa\n, but let's imagine that you now need to blast a much larger dataset for your research. This dataset can be downloaded with the following command:\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nwget http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/osgschool17/mouse_rna.tar.gz\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter un-tar'ing the file, you should be able to confirm that it's size is roughly 100 MB. Not only is this a bit large for file transfer, but it would take hours to complete a single \nblastx\n analysis for it. Also, the single output file would be huge.

First, you need to move your blast database into this public directory. If you remember the \"public\" directory in your home directory on the OSG Connect server \nuser-training.osgconnect.net\n, it's this location where you will place files that need to end up in the StashCache data origin.\n\n\nYou have already placed files in the \n~/stash/public\n directory in the previous exercise in order for it to be accessible to the HTTP proxies. The same directory is accessible to StashCache.\n\n\nAs the \npublic\n directory name indicates *your files placed in the \npublic\n directory will be accessible to anyone's jobs if they know how to use \nstashcp\n, though no one else will be able to edit the files, since only you can \nplace\n or \nchange\n files in your \npublic\n space. For your own work in the future, make sure that you never put any sensitive data in such locations.\n\n\nCheck the file on OSG Connect\n\n\nNext, you can check for the file and test the command that we'll use in jobs on the OSG Connect login node:\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nls public\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, load the \nstashcp\n module, which will allow you to test a copy of the file from StashCache into your home directory on \nlogin.osgconnect.net\n:\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nmodule load stashcp\n/strong\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nmodule load xrootd\n/strong\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nstashcp /user/%RED%username%ENDCOLOR%/public/pdbaa_files.tar.gz ./\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should now see the \npdbaa_files.tar.gz\n file in your current directory. Notice that we had to include the \n/user\n and \nusername\n in the file path for \nstashcp\n, which make sure you're copying from \nyour\n \npublic\n space.\n\n\nModify the Submit File and Wrapper\n\n\nReturn to your \nthur-data-stash\n directory on \nuser-training.osgconnect.net\n (you may already be connected) where you will modify the files as described below:\n\n\n\n\nAt the top of the wrapper script (after \n#!/bin/bash\n), add the line to activate OSG Connect modules, followed by the above two lines that load the \nstashcp\n module and to copy the \npdbaa_files.tar.gz\n file into the current directory of the job:\n\n\n\n\nmodule\n \nload\n \nxrootd\n\n\nmodule\n \nload\n \nstashcp\n\n\nstashcp\n /\nuser\n/\n%RED%username%ENDCOLOR\n%/\npublic\n/\npdbaa_files\n.\ntar\n.\ngz\n ./\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince HTCondor will no longer transfer or download the file for you, make sure to add the following line (or modify your existing \nrm\n command, if you're confident) to make sure the \npdbaa_files.tar.gz\n file is also deleted and not copied back as perceived output.\n\n\n\n\nrm pdbaa_files.tar.gz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelete the \nwget\n line from the job wrapper script \nblast_wrapper.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the following line to the submit file and update the \"requirements\" statement to require servers with OSG Connect modules (for accessing the \nstashcp\n module), somewhere before the word \nqueue\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+WantsStashCache = true\nrequirements = (OpSys == \nLINUX\n) \n (HAS_MODULES =?= true)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfirm that your queue statement is correct for the current directory.

If your 100 jobs from the previous exercise haven't started running yet, this job will not yet start. However, after it has been running for ~2 minutes, you're safe to continue to the next exercise!\n\n\nNote: Keeping StashCache 'Clean'\n\n\nJust as for data on a web proxy, it is VERY important to remove old files from StashCache when you no longer need them, especially so that you'll have plenty of space for such files in the future. For example, you would delete (\nrm\n) files from \npublic\n on \nuser-training.osgconnect.net\n when you don't need them there anymore, but only after all jobs have finished. The next time you use StashCache after the school, remember to first check for old files that you can delete.",

In particular, we want to convert large \\ \n.mov\n files to smaller (10-100s of MB) \nmp4\n files. \\ Just like the Blast database in the \nprevious exercise\n, these video files are too large to send to jobs using HTCondor's default \\ file transfer mechanism, so we'll be using the Stash tool to send our data to jobs. This exercise should take 25-30 minutes.\n\n\nData\n\n\nWe'll start by moving our source movie files into Stash, so that they'll be available to our jobs when they run out on OSG.\n\n\n\n\nLog into \nuser-training.osgconnect.net\n and move into the \npublic\n directory.\n\n\nThe video files are currently stored on the squid proxy from the first exercise this afternoon. To place them in Stash, download them \\\n\n\n\n\nusing \nwget\n: \\\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nwget http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/osgschool17/videos.tar.gz\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\\n\n\n\n\nOnce downloaded, untar the \ntar.gz\n file. It should contain three \n.mov\n files. (this may take a while since everyone else is likely doing the same thing)\n\n\nHow big are the three files? Which is the smallest? (Find out with \nls -lh\n.)\n\n\nWe're going to need a list of these files later. For now, let's save that list to a file in this directory by running \nls\n and redirecting the output to a file: \\\n\n\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nls *.MOV *.mov \n movie_list.txt\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you've examined the three \nmov\n files and created the list of files, remove the original \ntar.gz\n file.\n\n\n\n\nSoftware\n\n\nWe'll be using a multi-purpose media tool called \nffmpeg\n \\ to convert video formats. The basic command to convert a file looks like this: \\\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\n./ffmpeg -i input.mov output.mp4\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to resize our files, we're going to manually set the video bitrate and resize the frames, so that the resulting file is smaller.\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\n./ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -b:v 400k -s 640x360 output.mp4\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get the \nffmpeg\n program do the following:\n\n\n\n\nOn user-training.osgconnect.net\n, create a directory for this exercise and move into it.\n\n\nWe'll be downloading the \nffmpeg\n pre-built static binary from this page: \nhttp://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/\n. \\\n\n\n\n\nLook for the \nx86_64\n build. \\\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\nwget http://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/releases/ffmpeg-release-64bit-static.tar.xz\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the binary is downloaded, un-tar it, and then copy the main \nffmpeg\n program into your current directory: \\\n\n\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ntar -xf ffmpeg-release-64bit-static.tar.xz\n/strong\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\ncp ffmpeg-3.3.2-64bit-static/ffmpeg ./\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScript\n\n\nWe want to write a script that uses \nffmpeg\n to convert a \n.mov\n file to a smaller format. Our script will need to \ncopy\n \\ that movie file from Stash to the job's current working directory (as in the \nprevious exercise\n, \nrun\n the appropriate \nffmpeg\n command, \\ and then \nremove\n the original movie file so that it doesn't get transferred back to the submit server. This last step is \\ particularly important, as otherwise you will have large files transferring into the submit server and filling up your home directory space.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a file called \nrun_ffmpeg.sh\n, that does the steps described above. Use the name of the smallest \n.mov\n file \\\n\n\n\n\nin the \nffmpeg\n command. Once you've written your script, check it against the example below: \\\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\nmodule load stashcp\nstashcp /user/%RED%username%ENDCOLOR%/public/test_open_terminal.mov ./\n./ffmpeg -i test_open_terminal.mov -b:v 400k -s 640x360 test_open_terminal.mp4\nrm test_open_terminal.mov\n\n\n\n\n\n\\ In your script, the username should be replaced by your \nosg-connect\n username.\n\n\nUltimately we'll want to submit several jobs (one for each \n.mov\n file), but to start with, we'll run one job to \\ make sure that everything works.\n\n\nSubmit File\n\n\nCreate a submit file for this job, based on other submit files from the school (\nThis file, for example\n.) Things to consider:\n\n\n\n\nWe'll be copying the video file into the job's working directory, so make sure to request enough disk space for the input \nmov\n file and the output \nmp4\n file. \\\n\n\n\n\nIf you're aren't sure how much to request, ask a helper in the room.\n\n\n\n\n*Important* Don't list the name of the \n.mov\n in \ntransfer_input_files\n. Our job will be interacting with the input \\\n\n\n\n\n.mov\n files solely from within the script we wrote above.\n\n\n\n\nNote that we \ndo\n need to transfer the \nffmpeg\n program that we downloaded above. \\\n\n\n\n\ntransfer_input_files = ffmpeg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the same requirements as the previous exercise: \\\n\n\n\n\n+WantsStashCache = true\nrequirements = (OpSys == \nLINUX\n) \n (HAS_MODULES =?= true)\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial Job\n\n\nWith everything in place, submit the job. Once it finishes, we should check to make sure everything ran as expected:\n\n\n\n\nCheck the directory where you submitted the job. Did the output \n.mp4\n file return?\n\n\nAlso in the directory where you submitted the job - did the original \n.mov\n file return here accidentally?\n\n\nCheck file sizes. How big is the returned \n.mp4\n file? How does that compare to the original \n.mov\n input?\n\n\n\n\nIf your job successfully returned the converted \n.mp4\n file and \nnot\n the \n.mov\n file to the submit server, and the \n.mp4\n file was appropriately scaled down, then we can go ahead and convert all of the files we uploaded to Stash.\n\n\nMultiple jobs\n\n\nWe wrote the name of the \n.mov\n file into our \nrun_ffmpeg.sh\n executable script. To submit a set of jobs for all of our \n.mov\n \\ files, what will we need to change in:\n\n\n\n\nthe script? 2. the submit file?\n\n\n\n\nOnce you've thought about it, check your reasoning against \\ the instructions below.\n\n\nAdd an argument to your script\n\n\n\n\nLook at your \nrun_ffmpeg.sh\n script. What values will change for every job?\n\n\nThe input file will change with every job - and don't forget that the output file will too! Let's make them both into arguments. \\\n\n\n\n\nTo add arguments to a bash script, we use the notation \n$1\n for the first argument (our input file) and \n$2\n for the second argument (our output file name). \\ The final script should look like this: \\\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\nmodule load stashcp\nstashcp /user/%RED%username%ENDCOLOR%/public/\n$1\n ./\n./ffmpeg -i \n$1\n -b:v 400k -s 640x360 \n$2\n\nrm \n$1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\ Note that we use the input file name multiple times in our script, so we'll have to use \n$1\n multiple times as well.\n\n\nModify your submit file\n\n\n\n\nWe now need to tell each job what arguments to use. We will do this by adding an arguments line to our submit file. Because we'll only have \\\n\n\n\n\nthe input file name, the \"output\" file name will be the input file name with the \nmp4\n extension. That should look like this: \\\n\n\narguments = $(mov) $(mov).mp4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo set these arguments, we will use the \nqueue .. matching\n syntax that we learned on \nMonday\n. To \\ do so, we need to create a list of our input files. 3. In our submit file, we can then change our queue statement to: \\\n\n\n\n\nqueue mov from movie_list.txt\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you've made these changes, try submitting all the jobs!\n\n\nBonus\n\n\nIf you wanted to set a different output file name, bitrate and/or size for each original movie, how could you modify:\n\n\n\n\nmovie_list.txt\n 3.

Another alternative for handling large files (both input and output), especially if they are unique to each job, is a local \\ shared filesystem.

Take a look at the README file and then do the following:\n\n\n\n\nCompile the code. 2. Run the program without any arguments. 3. Based on the README, what is the largest amount of data we might expect?\n\n\n\n\nThis program generates all permutations of nucleotide sequences \\ surrounding a given DNA motif. We can choose the length of permutation we want both \\ before and after a motif of our choice. To use this program on the command line and save the output to a FASTA file, we can use the command:\n\n\n%\nUCL_PROMPT_SHORT% \nstrong\n./motif-flanks \n2\n AGTTCATGCCT \n2\n \n sequences.fa\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the usage information and README, the two numerical arguments can add up to 13, at most, and the middle sequence can be any \\ DNA sequence up to 20 characters. The largest output we can expect is around 4 GB.\n\n\nTest Job\n\n\nHaving output of up to 4 GB means two things: we will want to run a smaller \\ test before we run the program at its peak, and the output data will need to go into a shared location like Gluster, instead of returning \\ to the submit server.\n\n\nFirst, we'll create a shell script to serve as the job's executable.\n\n\n\n\nWhat commands do you need to put in the script? What do you need to do with the \nsequences.fa\n file before the job exits?\n\n\nOur script needs to run the \nmotif-flanks\n command as shown above, redirecting the output to a file called \nsequences.fa\n. Then, \\\n\n\n\n\nafter that command completes, the \nsequences.fa\n file should be moved to your Gluster directory, as it is too large to return to the \\ submit server as usual.\n\n\n\n\nWrite the script and then check it against the script below. Yours might look slightly different. \\\n\n\n\n\n#!/bin/sh\n\n\n./motif-flanks \n4\n GATTTTCGATC \n4\n \n sequences.fa\nmv sequences.fa /mnt/gluster/%RED%username%ENDCOLOR%/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the two arguments in the script (4 and 4) are much smaller than the total possible for the software (two values that add up to 13). This is \\\n\n\n\n\nbecause we want to run a smaller test before submitting a job with the largest possible combination of arguments.\n\n\nNext, create a submit file for this job, based on other submit files from the school. Some important considerations:\n\n\n\n\nWe're writing our file to the job's working directory, so make sure to request several GB of disk space.\n\n\nAdd a line to the file that ensures your job will land on computers that have access to Gluster (see the file from the \nlast exercise\n).\n\n\nThe \nexecutable\n will be the script you wrote above.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have a submit file that does all these things, submit the test job.\n\n\nOnce the job has completed, do the following:\n\n\n\n\nCheck the directory where you submitted the job. Has the \nsequences.fa\n file returned there, accidentally?\n\n\nCheck your Gluster directory. Did the \nsequences.fa\n file get copied there successfully?\n\n\nCheck file size. How big is the \nsequences.fa\n file? You can use the \nls -lh\n command with the filename to find out.\n\n\n\n\nIf your job successfully copied the \nsequences.fa\n file to Gluster and did \nnot\n return it to your submission directory on \\ the submit server, congratulations! Everything is working as it should and you can now submit a full job.\n\n\nFinal Job\n\n\nHaving done a test, it should be straightforward to run a \"full scale\" job. Edit your \nrun_motif.sh\n executable so that the \nmotif-flanks\n command \\ uses larger numerical arguments:\n\n\n./motif-flanks 6 GATTTTCGATC 7 \n sequences.fa\n\n\n\n\n\nThen submit your job.

Next, create a submit file for this job, based on other submit files from the school. Some important considerations:   We're writing our file to the job's working directory, so make sure to request several GB of disk space.  Add a line to the file that ensures your job will land on computers that have access to Gluster (see the file from the  last exercise ).  The  executable  will be the script you wrote above.   Once you have a submit file that does all these things, submit the test job.  Once the job has completed, do the following:   Check the directory where you submitted the job. Has the  sequences.fa  file returned there, accidentally?  Check your Gluster directory. Did the  sequences.fa  file get copied there successfully?  Check file size. How big is the  sequences.fa  file? You can use the  ls -lh  command with the filename to find out.

Along the way, you'll need to test some of the already written submit files. The first part of this exercise introduces the overall steps for the workflow and what pieces already exist (that you won't need to write yourself).\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nJoe Biologist studies the influence of genetic differences (genotypes) on the growth traits (phenotypes) of a common crop. He has come to you with some computing work he\u2019d like to automate as a workflow, so that he can scale out his research and run it on a much larger HTC compute system. He has used HTCondor to manually submit individual jobs (never used a DAG), but has only run jobs on a smaller, dedicated HTCondor cluster where he doesn\u2019t have to request CPU, disk, or RAM. He\u2019s not familiar with DAGman. He's getting annoyed by how many manual job submissions and summary scripts he has to run, especially as he's thinking of scaling out his work in a way that would be much more cumbersome - so he's asking you to help him organize all the steps into an optimized DAG workflow.\n\n\n(As you learn more details below, it might be helpful to draw a diagram that describes the steps of his workflow.)\n\n\nAfter asking Joe many questions, you realize the following things:\n\n\nA) Joe starts with a file called \ninput.csv\n that was made on his desktop.\n When you open this file in excel, Joe shows you that each row corresponds to an individual plant. For each individual, the first three columns are phenotype measurements for each of three different growth \ntraits\n (T240, T300, T360), and the remaining columns contain the genotype (A or B) of that individual across multiple genes (columns).\n\n\nB) At present, Joe does the following manual steps (for each of the three traits)\n to achieve a meaningful result from the data in \ninput.csv\n:\n\n\n\n\nJoe first submits a job that calculates a large number of hypothetical \npermutations\n of phenotype-genotype combinations for the trait. This produces a set of files containing all the permutations for that trait. 2. Joe then runs a script for each trait, to create a gzipped tar file of the \npermutation\n job results for that trait. 3. Joe then submits a second job for each trait, which uses the permutations that have been zipped together to perform a \nQTL mapping\n calculation. This calculation determines which genes were most important for the phenotype trait, relative to other possible genes exemplified in the random permutations. 4. As a final step for each trait, Joe runs a script that creates a gzipped tar file of all of the \npermutation\n and \nQTL mapping\n data for that trait, so that he can take it back to his desktop computer for final processing.\n\n\n\n\nC) For the \npermutation\n and \nQTL mapping\n calculations, Joe runs a special \nwrapper\n that then uses his main R scripts.\n For each type of calculation this perl script, \nrunR.pl\n, first installs R using files from Joe's proxy server and then sets up the R environment before running whatever R script has been indicated as an argument to \nrunR.pl\n. Therefore, the \nrunR.pl\n wrapper script is run as the HTCondor executable with the name of either R program as an argument to the wrapper (along with arguments to the R program, itself).\n\n\nD) The two tar steps that happen after the \npermutation\n and \nQTL mapping\n steps are simple shell scripts containing a relevant \ntar\n command,\n and can be run on the submit server because they create little CPU load and finish very quickly.\n\n\nE) When Joe has previously run the first step, of 10,000 permutations, as one Condor job, the job runs for hours on his own small cluster.\n He has cut the permutations of a single Condor job up into multiple, shorter Condor jobs of fewer permutations before, but he doesn\u2019t remember the details of how many jobs and how many permutations per job worked well. Furthermore, Joe would like to scale up to \n100,000\n permutations per trait this time. Unlike the \npermutation\n step, the \nQTL\n step finishes quite quickly; even with 10,000 permutations completed for each trait, the \nQTL\n step completes within several minutes.\n\n\nView Joe's files\n\n\n(but don't do anything with them until the next \nexercise\n, where you'll plan necessary developments of a workflow for Joe.)\n\n\nLog in to \nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n and move to a desired location in your home directory.

Before starting this section, make sure to first read \nExercise 1.1\n, which has important background information about Joe's intended work and how he has submitted jobs so far.\n\n\nYour mission\n\n\nYour goal is to plan out Joe\u2019s workflow based upon small-scale test jobs and, later, to write a full-scale DAG to actually run his workflow in production. In particular, you will need to do the following:\n\n\n\n\nOptimize the submit files for the \npermutation\n jobs of each trait,\n such that each trait takes advantage of high-throughput parallelization with some number of job \nprocesses\n. Each process should calculate a portion of the new total of 100,000 permutations per trait (versus the 10,000 permutations per trait that Joe has been working with previously).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimize submit file values for \"request_memory\" and \"request_cpus\"\n for each \npermutation\n and \nQTL mapping\n step, for each trait of the three traits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a single DAG file, with \npermutation\n and \nQTL mapping\n jobs for each of the three traits,\n including PRE and/or POST scripts for the \ntar\n scripts that need to be run.\n\n\n\n\nWe'll be working on the first two optimization steps during this session, and the second optimization step and DAG creation after the break, in \nExercise 1.3\n.\n\n\n*NOTE: In what follows, the only files you will need to modify are the submit files (and as specifically instructed). You will not need to modify any of the input files, output files, or scripts/programs. It is advisable that you split up some of the work within your pair or group in order to be time-efficient.\n\n\nDraw a diagram\n\n\nBased upon what you \nlearned from Joe\n, \ndraw the \ngeneral workflow\n that you would make\n for Joe (on paper), keeping in mind that there are 3 traits for which the \npermutation\n and \nQTL mapping\n steps need to be completed. (If you started drawing a diagram while reading the previous page, just extend it here). The tar steps will probably need to be PRE or POST scripts (you decide which is best). Think about what Joe's intended workflow means for the shape of the DAG, including PARENT-CHILD dependencies for JOBs in the DAG and the fact that the \npermutation\n step could be broken up into multiple processes of fewer total permutations, each. We'll come back to this diagram in the \nnext exercise\n after the break, when it's time to construct the full DAG.\n\n\nOptimize job components\n\n\nBefore we assemble the full DAG, we want to optimize each component of the workflow. This will include 3 optimization steps:\n\n\n1. Test the HTC optimization of the \npermutation\n step.\n\n\nYou will need to determine the number of permutations that should be batched in a single job process, if each process needs to run in ~30 minutes for good HTC scaling. To do this, you will need to run some test jobs, to see how long it takes a single job process to run, say, 10, 100, or 1000 permutations.\n\n\nTo run these test jobs:\n\n\n\n\nModify one of the permutation submit files to \u201cqueue\u201d 10 jobs (so that you can average time between the 10 test jobs)\n\n\nAdd \"request_cpus = 1\" according to Joe's indication\n\n\nAdd reasonable first guesses for \"request_memory\" and \"request_disk\" (say, 1 GB?).\n\n\nMake a few copies of this submit file so that you can change the last argument (the number of permutations) from \"10000\" to \"10\", \"100\", or \"1000\".
